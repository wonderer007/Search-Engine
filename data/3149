Job Description
Background:
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is the world's largest humanitarian network, reaching 150 million people each year through its 187 member National Societies. The Organisation acts before, during and after disasters and health emergencies in order to meet the needs and improve the lives of vulnerable people. Our work is guided by seven fundamental principles (humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary service, unity and universality).
The ongoing crisis in Syria has so far forced the migration of over 2 million refugees to neighboring countries. In Jordan, many refugees sought refuge in camps. As the existing camps are nearing saturation, the Jordanian authorities have opted for the creation of a new refugee camp in Azraq, which is currently under construction. The IFRC was approached
to setup a referral level hospital facility. This hospital functions as a 24/7 secondary level health care facility in the camp. The inpatient capacity will be
up to 130 beds, providing obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, surgical services and general medicine services.
The hospital consists of one operating theater, a delivery suite, inpatient wards and treatment areas, an x-ray and a laboratory. It also provides an outpatient department for referral consultations as well as an emergency room. The hospital is planned to open with 40 beds and the bed capacity will gradually increase as the camp population increases.
