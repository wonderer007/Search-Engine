Foreign graduates can’t get jobs because of “Singaporeans first”?

It was revealed that foreign graduates in Singapore are waiting up to six months to get a job on average. (“Foreign graduates on S’pore govt bonds finding job hunt tough”, Straits Times, Apr 29)
A ministry spokesman spoke through ST that eight in 10 foreign students on MOE grants who graduated from a polytechnic or university in the past three years either started work immediately or applied to the ministry to start serving their bonds at a later date so that they could further their studies.
“The rest, she added, may not be bond defaulters as some could still be job hunting.”
20% bond defaulters?
Does this mean that about 2 out of 10 may be bond defaulters?
If they do not indicate after a period of time,  say about 9 months that they have not started work, applied to further their studies or still cannot find a job. Should they not be classified as bond defaulters?
If so, why is the Minister of Education unable to even give an estimate of how many have defaulted on their bonds all these years? ()
Foreign graduates cost more to hire?
It is stated that the minimum requirement for the higher-tier Employment Pass (EP) has been raised to $3,300, however many companies are not willing to pay that much for a fresh graduate.
But since employers do not have to contribute CPF for foreigners – they save 17% of salaries  when they employ employment pass holders.
So, the equivalent salary of a Singaporean  fresh graduate is $2,820 as it would cost the same as the employment pass minimum of $3,300 ($2,820 times 1.17).
However, the average gross monthly salary among fresh university graduates in full-time jobs in 2013 was $3,229, while the median gross monthly salary was $3,050 .
Therefore, these numbers may indicate that the perception being apparently promulgated in the subject news report that fresh foreign graduates have difficulties in getting a job, due to the higher minimum EP salary and preference for Singaporean graduates may be flawed – because hiring a foreigner on an employment pass at $3,300 is equivalent in labour costs to hiring a Singaporean at $2,820 – which is $478 ($3,229 times 1.17 minus $3,300) less than the average salary of a Singaporean graduate.
In other words, it may still be much cheaper to hire a foreign fresh graduate – not to mention the other advantages like males not having to serve national service, etc.
Why do you think that the real growth in university graduates’ starting salary is estimated to be negative over the last 7 years or so?
The article also touched on how the companies is opting for the alternative, which is to hire the foreign students on a lower-skilled S Pass, which has a lower salary requirement of $2,200 and offers lower chances of securing permanent residency. But many companies said that they cannot do so because they have reached the quota for S Pass workers.
This seemingly innocent fact may highlight the alarming issue that most companies may “max out” their S Pass quotas because foreign graduates may be more willing to work at such relatively low starting pay.
Why do you think that the median starting salary of polytechnic fresh graduates declined in real terms by an estimated 5 per cent over the last 5 years or about minus 1 per cent per annum?
End of the day, if foreign graduates are finding hard to look for jobs, would it not mean that local graduates might find it harder to look for jobs?

let see u cannot get a job..ow ole r the graduates bytheway? 25?…bythe time they hav a job with a stable cpf contributions by aged 35..still cannot managed to save a deposits for the hdb flat let alone a motorsikal COE…so parthored for a DECADE..still penisless…DIE CORK stand..~sigh~
subsidies
The foreign students are here on MOE subsidies and some on MOE scholarships with 3-6 year bonds. If they cannot find jobs to fulfill their bonds, then how? Will MOE recover the investments through liquidated damages? Can MOE ask for liquidated damages if they tried their best but cannot find jobs? Will MOE then invest resources (taxpayer monies) to help foreigners to find jobs to fulfill their KPIs to recover their “investments”? Or will MOE release them from their bonds and lose these investments?
Please don’t give us the “they will carry goodwill” thingy. Our scholars who study overseas will qualify for this “goodwill” thingy too, leading to questions about their loyalty to Singapore.
So how? MOE? How do you want to solve this dilemma? Rock and a hard place. Empatize with you, but you must answer for your pay and bonuses.

No scandal
Fail to see the point of this rambling article.
“End of the day, if foreign graduates are finding hard to look for jobs, would it not mean that local graduates might find it harder to look for jobs?”
Errr…..no.

I think the article is trying to say “if foreign uni graduates have difficulty in securing their jobs within first 6 months”,
our local polytechnic and ITE grads will face even more difficulties in securing their jobs as the foreign uni grads don’t mind being paid lesser starting wages of $2,200?
If my above supposition is correct, then how much will our polytechnic and ITE grads’ starting pay be? $1,700 to $1,800?
More graduates from overseas
India already has 700 universities and 48,000-plus colleges and institutes across the country.
According to the data last gathered by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), 62% of universities and 90% of colleges count as average or below-average.
But those numbers are based on information collected from a mere 20% of the total number of institutions that obtained NAAC-accreditation.
More graduates from overseas
According to recent reports, the employability rates of Indian graduates are estimated at between 34% to 53%.
More graduates from overseas
Unemployment in the Philippines rose to 7.5% in January, up from 6.5% in the previous quarter and 7.1% a year ago, or some 2.96 million unemployed people.
One in five is a college graduate. Unemployment among younger graduates can be as high as 45%.
The TUC said some 700,000 graduates, including those from technical and vocational institutions, would enter a job market where unemployment prospects for those under 29 years old are particularly poor. Almost 50% of the population aged 15 to 23 is unemployed.
A large number of graduates in the Philippines migrate to other Asian and Middle Eastern countries to take up jobs. But economists have criticised them as having skills not suited to the global economy either.
It put the number of Philippine citizens seeking jobs abroad at around 200,000.
More than 120,000 hotel and restaurant management graduates are produced each year, but few of them can be absorbed by the domestic labour market and they are unable to work overseas without additional training.
Around 80,000 nurses qualify each year but local hospitals absorb fewer than 5,000 new nurses. Some 400,000 licensed nurses are currently not gainfully employed, according to government figures.
Philippine Overseas Employment Administration data show that only 10,000 nurses can find work in the Middle East, United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Canada every year.
More graduates from overseas
According to the report, over 1.2 million workers were reported as “lacking jobs” by the end of 2013, accounting for 2.63 percent of total laborers.
At the time of Thuyet’s report, ten years ago, junior colleges and universities in Vietnam were already producing more than 200,000 bachelors every year, 10 times higher than demand. Today, the “capacity” of the universities is now double that, at 400,000.
Under the national human resource (HR) development program, Vietnam set a target of 3.5 million of workers with higher education by 2015. However, the country already had 3.7 million workers with higher education by the end of 2013.
Deputy Minister of Labor, War Invalids and Social Affairs Doan Mau Diep said on Tuoi Tre that a large percentage of Vietnamese
remain unemployed or have to take low-paying jobs because of the “oversupply of unqualified workers with higher education”.
Vietnam is striving to have 460 universities and junior colleges by 2020.
Dr Luong Hoai Nam, an analyst, has pointed out that 37 percent of university graduates cannot find jobs because they lack the necessary job skills. Moreover, 83 percent of them lack life skills, in the eyes of employers,

Wow ! Thank you very much for your wealth of knowledge sources… : -) shall go through the recommended websites …
Here’s wishing everyone Happy Labor Day!

After reading all these, I am curious whether MOM knows or tracks those who under declare their qualification instead of catching those who over declare? Because now you under declare you can get S Pass or lower P level jobs, instead of no jobs.

I don’t think so…

Why are you so concern about foreigners not securing jobs..?????? We should be more concern about our “natives” securing jobs first. As Singaporeans, staying in the city states, all should look after each other and try to ensure the healthy aspect of our countryman. Any other areas that we cannot handle, then only we consider outsiders. Don’t ever forget, the country was paid, built and defend by the “natives” from the effort of the our older generations leaders (LKY and team) working closely with the “natives”. If at this stage, the society disintegrate, tell me who is responsible…?????????????
curious question
I only want to ask a question a bit out of point.
Why local students call local, but foreign student not called foreign students but call international students?
Why local qualification call local diploma or local degree. But foreign degree is “international” degree and not called foreign degree?
Our local student and local diploma/degree got no international standards? Only foreign things then can qualify have international standard? International alway sound better, but foreign is on par with local in terms of lingo. Why must alway make foreign sound better and make them “international” like our local not “international” qualify?
HUAT AH
Why local poly/uni call local poly/uni but foreign poly/uni is call international poly/uni? Majiam that local one cannot international standard only foreign one can.
Duh
PAP so generous – give foreigners scholarships and then give them a job in the country. Treat foreigners just like locals.

Quite disappointed with this article. It’s just too simplistic to claim that foreign grads having difficulties means local grads are worse off. MOM’s various rules does have an impact on foreign hire.
