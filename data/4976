UAE's robotics and automation sector to scale new heightsStaff Report / 3 May 2014
According to IFR,
the global demand for industrial robots reached an all-time-high of about 168,000 units in 2013.
The robotics and automation market in the Middle East is expected to see increased investments as the UAE steers its way to become the region’s robotics hub.
According to the International Federation of Robotics, or IFR, the global demand for industrial robots reached an all-time-high of about 168,000 units in 2013. By 2015, the IFR estimates the worldwide robot sales to increase by five per cent on an average as a result of the opening up of huge consumer markets in the Bric countries, South-east Asia and the Middle East.
The UAE continues to be one of the key players in the regional automation market which is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of more than six per cent during 2012-16.
Currently, the technology is gaining popularity in the healthcare, education, infrastructure, safety and security, aeronautics and aviation sectors in the Middle East. In the UAE, robotics has been successfully used across various sectors including the Dubai Metro, the world’s longest, fully-automated metro network, and the world’s largest automated parking facility at the Dubai International Financial Centre.
Addressing these opportunities, the Robot Technology Exhibition, or Rtex, will host the first robotics and automation conference in Dubai on May 12. The conference, which is part of the pre-launch event, aims to bring together government and industry leaders to raise awareness and examine how the emirate can position itself as a regional robotics hub.
The conference includes a talk by Mohammad Al Shamsi, founder of the Emirates Robotics Club, who will share insights on the future of robotics in the Middle East from a young Emirati’s point of view. Alongside this, Dr Nikolaos Mavridis, director of Interactive Robots and Media Lab, will discuss the growth of robotics in the region. Dr Claus Risager, partner and director of Blue Ocean Robotics, will introduce delegates to role and business potentials of robotics in the UAE’s education and healthcare sectors. The conference also includes a session on the European robotic roadmap and will explore new opportunities for cooperation with the Mena, under the leadership of Dr Jose Barata, assistant professor at UNL and researcher at Uninova.
“As the industry expands, [robotics] offers huge growth opportunities for local business to invest, innovate and drive advancement in the technologies of tomorrow,” said Golnaz van Huyssteen, operations manager ot Rtex.
