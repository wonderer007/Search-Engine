PR Manager / Consultant - Dubai - 15,000-17,000 AED/monthEver fancied moving somewhere more exotic?! One of the Middle East's top integrated marketing agencies is looking for a PR Manager / Consultant to join their highly talented team. Working across a range of the agency's clients, you will be responsible for producing strong, effective PR communications, with a particular focus on writing. You will be client-facing, able to discuss their needs and then devise an appropriate PR strategy. You will write press releases, message strategy, content strategy, online content and general marketing communications. You will work alongside a marketing account manager on some clients (who use the agency for more than one discipline), but will be the sole account manager for PR-specific clients. You will come from an agency-background, or have worked in a consultancy capacity, therefore used to working on more than one brand/project at a time. You will be at Senior Account Manager level, able to work autonomously and with the gravitas to instil confidence in the clients you work with. You will have a well-stocked portfolio of written pieces, able to send samples of your work, and be genuinely passionate about writing. Unfortunately only native English speakers will be considered for this role, given the amount of English writing that is involved. This is a fantastic opportunity to do some excellent work for an agency that has a firm grip on the Arab marketplace and one of the most influential client portfolios in the gulf.
