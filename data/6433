Energy Ministry announces submission of Abu Dhabi’s bid file to host WEC
: Monday, May 05 - 2014 @ 15:28
The UAE ministry of Energy announced the submission of UAE’s bid file to host the World Energy Congress (WEC) of 2019 in its 24th version. The Conference is a platform for discussing energy challenges bringing together the largest elite group of experts, decision-makers and key players in the global energy sector worldwide. Voting for the hosting country is due to take place in Colombia during October 2014.
In the event Abu Dhabi wins the bid to host the Congress, it would mark the first time the conference is held in an OPEC (Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) member state since it was first held 90 years ago. The UAE is considered to be the only OPEC member exporting hydrocarbon resources while contributing to the promotion and development of investment in renewable energy markets locally and globally.
To win the bid to host WEC 2019, the UAE relies on its experience and prestige as a pioneer in the various fields of conventional and renewable energy and looks forwards to allowing participants and members to seize investment opportunities in the market and creating a platform for exchange of information and expertise in various energy fields.
It has also been announced that preparations have commenced to issue the ‘State of Energy Report in the UAE 2015’ in collaboration with the Dubai Carbon Centre of Excellence (DCCE) and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). The preparation of this report comes in line with UAE’s energy strategy and for highlighting the best practices and success stories of national activities in the process of developing the energy sector, renewable energy contribution in the UAE’s energy diversification policy, energy efficiency criteria as well as the consolidation of efforts to achieve clean, safe and sustainable energy as the main basis of promoting economic and social growth and development. The UAE is currently undertaking fast-paced efforts towards diversifying energy sources and seeks to achieve a proportion of clean energy of up to 24% of the overall energy in the UAE.
H.E. Dr Mattar Hamed Al Neyadi, Undersecretary of the Ministry of Energy, revealed the Report plans and noted its strategic importance for the UAE during the transformation process which the UAE leads towards green economy and sustainable development, hence meeting the ambitious objectives of UAE’s Agenda 2021. His Excellency added that the symbolism behind choosing the ‘Abu Dhabi Ascent’ event to announce the commencement of preparation of the report aims at “presenting the Report in the context of the commitments expected of world leaders by taking tangible steps to tackle climate change issues”.
The energy report of 2015 will also focus on the importance of steps taken by the UAE in the context of its efforts aimed at defining the features of renewable energy and reducing the effects of climate change as part of the international sustainability efforts. Within the framework of efforts to create a future based on sustainability, the energy report seeks to become a printed reference of best practices and success stories in the field of sustainable energy in the UAE. The Minister concluded his address by inviting writers and experts to share their contributions for inclusion in the Report.
The press conference was attended by H.E. Dr Mattar Hamed Al Neyadi, Undersecretary of the Ministry of Energy, H.E. Eng. Fatima Al Foora Al Shamsi, Assistant Undersecretary for Electricity Affairs at the Ministry of Energy and Mr. Sayed Aqa, UNDP Resident Representative in the UAE, in addition to a gathering of global leaders, partners and bodies sponsoring the Report.
The State of Energy Report 2015 is due to be launched at the World Energy day on 22 October 2014.
