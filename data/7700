Company Profile:Autodesk, Inc., is a leader in 3D design, engineering and
entertainment software. Customers across the manufacturing, architecture,
building, construction, and media and entertainment industries—including the
last 18 Academy Award winners for Best Visual Effects—use Autodesk software to
design, visualize, and simulate their ideas before they're ever built or
created. From blockbuster visual effects and buildings that create their own
energy to electric cars and the batteries that power them, the work of our 3D
software customers is everywhere you look.Through our apps for iPhone,
iPad, iPod, and Android, we're also making design technology accessible to
professional designers as well as amateur designers, homeowners, students, and
casual creators. Whether it's a kid looking to build a new contraption, a
seasoned pro sketching out a great new idea, or someone who just wants to amp
up their creative output, we're taking technology originally built for movie
studios, automakers, and architectural firms, and making it available to anyone
who wants to create and share their ideas with the world.Since its introduction of
AutoCAD software in 1982, Autodesk continues to develop the broadest portfolio
of state-of-the-art 3D software for global markets.
