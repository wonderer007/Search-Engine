In some locations around the world, Hilton Worldwide manages hotel properties on behalf of a third party owner.
At many of those properties, the Hotel owner is the actual employer, and Hilton Worldwide performs recruiting and hiring functions on behalf of the owner.
I understand and agree that, by applying through this site, I may be applying for a position with a company other than Hilton Worldwide where Hilton Worldwide is serving only as the recruiter and will not be my actual employer.
