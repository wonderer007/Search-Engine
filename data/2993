Job Description
The development manager is the functional line manager for software development. Lead developers and developers will report into a development manager. A development manager advocates for the development constituency in the MSF Team Model. A development manager is responsible for the capacity of the software development team as measured by metrics such as velocity, and for the variation in capacity and rate of productivity and quality as measured by metrics; such as unplanned work, work remaining, quality indicators, and actual quality versus planned velocity. The development manager takes responsibility for the continuous improvement and learning in the software development team. A development manager does not have direct responsibility for the flow of a project and the value in the product solution but instead works with the project manager to provide the resources to facilitate the smooth flow of the project through development.
The development manager also acts as an infrastructure architect. An infrastructure architect advocates for the architecture constituency in MSF Team Model. The infrastructure architect is a specialist role focused on the deployment topology of both the physical computers and the virtual servers and services which run on them. An infrastructure architect works with the deployment designer tool and liaises with the solution architect to coordinate the application and system designs against the intended deployment configuration.
Another role the development manager fulfills is the solutions architect role. The solution architect advocates for the architecture constituency in the MSF Team Model. The solution architect is responsible for maintaining the architectural integrity of the product and ensuring the success of the project by designing the foundations on which all the value can be realized. This includes defining both the organizational structure of the application and the physical structure of its deployment. In these endeavors, the solution architect’s goal is to reduce complexity, decrease coupling and regression effects, and increase the cohesiveness of components by partitioning the system into parts which can be built and tested independently. The resulting architecture is extremely important because it not only dictates how the system will be built going forward but also establishes whether the application will exhibit the many traits that are essential for a successful project. These include its usability, whether it is reliable and maintainable, whether it meets performance and security standards, and whether it can be evolved easily in the face of changing requirements.
