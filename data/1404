UNDP Pakistan has been leading efforts to analyse the emerging challenges and opportunities as a result of the devolution process, enhancing understanding of the amendment.

In addition, UNDP has held provincial and national consultations in collaboration with the Forum of Federations (FOF), which works on strengthening federal systems.

Pakistan became an official member of FOF in March 2012; other members include Canada, Australia, Switzerland, Germany and Brazil.
