The Greens of St. Andrews are a long ways from the local front nine, but the feeling at the tee is exactly the same. We don’t make equipment for professionals or amateurs; we make equipment for golfers. We know that in a game of inches, what matters isn’t the name of the course, but a love of the game. Our clubs, and everything else we make, blend a commitment to golf’s history with a drive to bring modern ideas to life. At TaylorMade Golf, vision meets precision.
TaylorMade is a place for those who value innovation and never stop seeking ways to push performance forward and improve the game, while always honoring its tradition and its origins. A passion for competition, both on and off the course, defines the way we approach our work. We believe that true golf people make the best golf products. And that’s why the best players in the world play with TaylorMade
