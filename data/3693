Thinking of moving to Dubai to work?
Justin McGuire, Managing Director at MCG Associates, provides an insight for candidates considering making the move.
After the winter the UK has just suffered, I would be looking to up sticks and move somewhere more temperate if I hadn’t done so already. The United Arab Emirates – and Dubai in particular – is an ideal option if you are seriously looking to gain experience and advance your career abroad.
Not only is there year-round sunshine and the necessary air-conditioning that goes with it, but living in Dubai means living tax free. Moreover, salary levels are higher than in the UK, so from a financial angle you are already quid’s-in. As an example, an account manager in an agency in the UK will earn around £30-35 thousand a year. In Dubai you can expect to take home £40-45 thousand.
The population of Dubai sits at around two-and-a-half million, which means that there are less people competing for roles and, because of the demand, it allows people to move up the career ladder far faster than back home.
The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region has seen huge investment in recent years, with several of the major global advertising and marketing agencies, such as WPP and Publicis setting up offices in Dubai. Indeed, Publicis’s media offering in Dubai is now the third most profitable in the whole group.
Just comparing how agencies did at Cannes this year – where they picked up 33 awards – and five years earlier – where they came away empty handed - shows just how far the industry has come out here.
With accelerated growth in the region, companies are moving their key staff out to Dubai. Take for example one Omnicom agency, which has approximately twenty-nine different nationalities in their offices. Due to the semi-transient nature of the population – which is unique to Dubai, because no-one really comes here with an ambition to stay permanently – there is a large ex-patriot community; there are currently around 240 thousand Britons living here - a number that has doubled since 2009. The atmosphere is very cosmopolitan, with ex-pats outnumbering locals in Dubai eleven to one.
There are some cultural adjustments that you would need to accept if you moved to the Middle East. The normal working week is Sunday to Thursday, which may taking a bit of getting used to, but once you do; you will find the weeks actually seem to go more quickly. Due to the multi-cultural make-up of Dubai, it is a much more liberal country than others in the area.
Living expenses are very similar to London, however, alcohol is expensive but a taxi ride across town won’t set you back more than a fiver. Relocating doesn’t need to be a daunting prospect either. My company is experienced in placing candidates from the UK and Europe in Dubai, the wider Emirates and the rest of MENA region.  Most companies will fly out spouse and children, paying for visas and offering a contribution towards luggage. However, long-gone are the days where a house would come with the job. Dubai is seen as a lifestyle choice now rather than a hardship posting.
Companies all have HR specialists who are well versed in the red-tape and will help organise everything you need. Dubai is a pay-up-front culture, so companies will often give you a loan to help pay rent advances and then deduct this directly from your salary. Most organisations offer two to four weeks in a hotel, while you find yourself a house or flat and medical insurance for you and your family is also pretty standard.
Childcare is very cheap in Dubai and there are a wide variety of international schools, catering for the UK, US and Australian systems, but they can be expensive. However, marketing jobs that are client side often provide a schooling allowance, so if you have a large brood, you might find a job in that particular niche easier on the pocket.
Because the weather is phenomenal, life in Dubai is all about the outdoors. If you want to go camping in the desert, swim with dolphins or just sun yourself on the Palm, then this is the place for you. One of the best bits about living here is the proximity to other countries. The Seychelles and Sri Lanka are only three hours away and Goa is perfect for a weekend break.
And finally, if you are tempted, then arrange your interview for a Sunday – it will be in English via Skype. Sadly, the days of flying candidates over for interview are long gone.
