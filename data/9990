Y o u r   S a f e t y
There are several commonsense factors you should consider when applying
for a post, attending an interview or working abroad.
Do not provide any banking or credit card information when applying
for a job.
If you are concerned about divulging your home address in your resume,
consider using a post office box or similar forwarding address.
When attending a job interview, if you feel in any way uncomfortable
with the situation or the person/s you are dealing with, walk away. Also
consider your work location, do you feel it is safe? Would you be happy
to work there late at night?
Always let a friend know that you are attending an interview, when and
where. acquaint yourself fully with how to get to the interview and how
to get back.
An interview should always be arranged in daylight hours.
If the job appears to be "too good to be true", it probably is. Fully
research the employer via web forums, search engines and previous
employees. Most reputable employers should be happy to put you in touch
with previous/current staff.
As previously stated, no reputable employer will ask you for money
(even for a visa, work-permit etc.). If a tefl.com advertiser does ask
you for payment, refuse and
immediately.
As a TEFL.com member your resume contact details are not in the public
domain. Only registered employers can view your resume (contact details
removed) via our resume search engine. If an employer wishes to view
your contact details they are required to use a "ResumeView". Our system
logs all resumes viewed by the employer. You can also check as to which
employers have viewed your resume at
http://www.tefl.com/career/rv_history.html or by clicking on "Who's
viewed my resume" within your account page.
Register with your embassy as soon as you arrive in the host country.
Your safety is paramount. If you feel uneasy with any part of the
application procedure or interview, walk away!
Going abroad...
Get
and check that the cover is appropriate.
Check what vaccinations you need at least 6 weeks before you go and consider whether you need to take extra health precautions
