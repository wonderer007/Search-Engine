Singapore protesters attack immigration, jobs policies AFP News
- Thursday, May 1, 2014 Hundreds of Singaporeans rallied Thursday to denounce the government's immigration and labour policies amid a fresh wave of anti-foreigner sentiment in the city-state. Protesters, estimated by an AFP reporter to number around 400, wore black headbands with the words "Protect Singaporean Rights" in red as they chanted slogans against the long-ruling People's Action Party. Protest leader Gilbert Goh, an employment counsellor, said the rally was intended to display Singaporeans' continued dissatisfaction with the large foreign population in the city-state. "When we speak up for the country, we are branded as xenophobes, " he told AFP. "I am doing all this for my country, I am willing to die for my country." Goh, however, dropped plans to ask rally participants to deface a poster of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong after receiving a stern warning from the police. Singaporeans make up just over 60 percent of the country's 5.4 million population. Its low fertility rate forces the island republic to rely heavily on guest workers to power its affluent economy. The protest took place at a designed free-speech park amid a wave of attacks in social media directed at the Filipino community over a planned festival celebrating Philippine Independence Day in June along busy Orchard Road. Prime Minister Lee had denounced the abusive anti-Filipino attacks as the work of a few "trolls" and said people who harassed organisers of the planned event were "a disgrace to Singapore". Protester Richard Lim said at Thursday's rally that Singaporeans remain dissatisfied with the government's immigration policies despite restrictions on the intake of foreign workers and a reduction in the approval of permanent residency applications. "You take the trains, you will know why we are still angry. Everywhere we go it is crowded. They don't listen to us when we say don't bring in any more foreigners!" said the 57-year-old security guard.
Thursday's rally fell short of protests attended by several thousand people in early 2013 after the government published a policy paper indicating that the government was looking at a future population of 6.9 million. Critics accuse foreigners of competing with Singaporeans for jobs, housing and medical care as well as choking public transport even though the unemployment rate stands at just over two percent -- one of the lowest figures in the world. 13 comments To EVERYONE in this WEBSITE, Especially to PAP , Opposition Parties & All Singaporean , This UNHAPPY EVENT also highlight One Cruel Reality in Singapore Labour Market : Not only blue collar jobs , even white collar jobs of Singaporean are in danger too, due to that Greedy Singapore employers will hire Singaporean temporarily , like 1 - 6 months , & then SACK them with All types of EXCUSES , including Unscrupulously fabricated EXCUSES . Then these bosses COMPLAIN to Relevant Authorities, like MOM, that Singaporean employees , for both with Degree & Relevant qualification , are Bad , Choosy , Lousy & etc. & then , use these “ EXCUSES “ to PRESS Singapore Government to allow more " Foreign Talents " or any one with little educational qualification to be HIRE for PROFESSIONAL JOBS by them , BUT , paid such people with LOW SALARIES : Eg : Engineer with recognized Degree from NUS, NTU or other recognized universities by MOE & several years of relevant working experience usually command salary of $3000 - $5000 /month , BUT , Foreign " engineer " that has NO recognized degrees or required certificates & with several years of " Relevant Working Experience " in other countries , can be paid salary at around $1000/month Eg : Architect that had recognized Degree from NUS, NTU or other recognized universities by MOE & several years of relevant working experience usually command salary of $6000 - $10000 /month , BUT , Foreign " architect " that has NO recognized degrees or required certificates & with several years of " Relevant Working Experience " in other countries , can be paid salary at around $1000 - $2000/month Eg : Accountant that had recognized Degree from NUS, NTU or other recognized universities by MOE usually command salary of $3000 - $8000 /month , BUT , foreign " accountant " that has NO recognized degrees or required certificates & with several years " Relevant Working Experience " in other countries , can be paid salary at around $1000 - $1500/month [ In other countries, if a person has enough so called " Relevant Work Experience ", a person can be qualified as " High-Level , Qualified Professionals " in their own countries , despite lack of education . It's like Singapore in 1950s to even early 2000s , even having Primary School Education alone is enough to be Top Management in big companies ] At most, these Cunning Bosses hired these " Cheap Professionals " & then give them the Positions of Engineers , Design Architects , Financial Manager & etc . in their companies, without letting the clients or other irrelevant people know of the Truth BECAUSE nobody want to check it any way ] Sometimes , the Bosses even FALSIFY Labour Quota on the Singaporean employees in the Companies or Project works & report to the MOM that they had followed Labour Laws . These usually happen in Construction Industries, Heavy Engineering Industries & other industries or companies that are HIGHLY CONSERVATIVE & LABOUR INTENSIVE , in which BOTH UNPROFESSIONALISM & UNETHICAL PRATICES have BECOME A WAY OF LIFE in the CORPORATE / INDUSTRIAL CULTURES in such industries over many years. * NOTE : Singaporean Work force is one of the MOST HIGHLY EDUCATED & BEST in the world, even recognized internationally by reputable international bodies , so Singaporean employees can’t be that Bad or Lousy to be justified easily to be SACK by management of Singaporean employers . I wonder whether our HIGHLY PAID TOP CIVIL SERVANTS have really CHECK on this PROBLEMS over so many years ? Any COMMENTS from you PEOPLE out there ? ? ?

To EVERYONE in this WEBSITE, Especially PAP, Opposition Parties & ALL Singaporean , What is the point that our Key Civil Servants are the most talented & smartest people in the world , if they only use their intelligence to HARM PEOPLE & SOCIETY to profit themselves ? Purposely don't use their talents to serve the people & society , BUT , BUT to use such Talents to do such bad things . . . . . . . . . really an act that cannot be accepted by Singaporean . Purposely don't use their talents to serve the people & society , BUT , BUT to use such Talents to do such bad things really cannot be accepted by Singaporean . Then if that is the case, they are more or less the same as Well-known Scandal Making Culprits & Bad People like that T T Durai [ That Damned Ex-CEO of NKF that had caused the Big Damned NKF Scandal in 2005 ] , Pastor Kong Hee [ That head pastor of City Harvest Church that seem to be the main cause of the recent Big Scandal of City Harvest Church ] , Richard Yong [ That crony of T T Durai in the NKF Top Management that help T T Durai to do a lot of bad things in NKF when T T Durai was still the NKF's CEO ] , Ex-Law Professor, Dr Tey , Ng Boon Gay, Peter Lim Chin Pang & WORST , like those Greedy ex-bosses of Lehman Brothers & banks in Wall Street before the Bankruptcy of Lehmen Brothers . . . . Especially , the ex-bosses of Lehman Brothers & banks in Wall Street that had brought about the 2007 FINANCIAL CRISIS , BUT , BUT , these ex-bosses had already earn many millions of dollars before the Financial Crisis & they took all their many millions of dollars away, to enjoy luxurious life of kings & queens for the rest of their life, after they had left their unfortunate companies to go Bankrupt or Near to Bankruptcy . * NOTE : The Last CEO of Lehman Brother was reported to earn about US$483,000,000 from Lehman Brothers in about 8 years as CEO of Lehman Brothers ( This work put to be about US$60,000,000 per year for his salary ) , but he had caused Lehman Brothers to go Bankrupt . Some of these ex-bosses even emigrant to ovesea with all their many millions of dollars & do not come back to their country any more , so they don’t really care the life or death of their own people in own country ] Really give us an impression that Top Civil Servants in Singapore Civil Service , which is regarded internationally as the HIGEST PAID & MOST EXPENSIVE in the WORLD , are more interested in to earn FREE & VERY EASY HIGH SALARIES & also earn FREE & EASY COMFORTABLE LIFE / ZONE IN THEIR WORK PLACES than truly want to work hard & swear hard to serve the people . . . . . . Also , really give an impression that Top Civil Servants in Singapore Civil Service regard themselves as highly privelleged “ Elite Class “ that expect Singaporean to serve them like their yesmen & obedient slaves that must be ready to sacrifice for them to make them Rich & base on Like or Dislike . . PERHAPS , it is a VERY , VERY , VERY GOOD IDEA that PAP had suffer badly in General Election 2011 & LOST BADLY in the By-Election in Punggol East in 2012, so as to teach PAP a BIG , GOOD LESSON that it don’t forget Don’t you ALL in this Website THINK so ? ? ? Any COMMENTS from you PEOPLE out there ? ? ?

To EVERYONE in this WEBSITE, Especially to PAP , Opposition Parties & All Singaporean , In Singapore , Employers HIRED & FIRED Singaporean employees SO EASILY has SHOWN US one VERY CRUEL REALITY : = > Singaporean Employers have VERY STRONG CORPORATE CULTURE & ORGANIZATIONAL VALUE OF HIRE & FIRE SINGAPOREAN EMPLOYEES EASILY when they see fit OR , base on their like or dislike . . . Then these bosses COMPLAIN to Relevant Authorities, like MOM, that Singaporean employees , for both with Degree & Relevant qualification , are Bad , Choosy , Lousy & etc. & then , use these “ EXCUSES “ , including Unscrupulously fabricated EXCUSES , to PRESS Singapore Government to give in to these demands , like : (1). Allow more Foreigners to enter Singapore without control & PAID at LOW SALARIES (2). Allow them more able to ABUSE & EXPLOIT their employees through Lenient Employment Laws , like press them to commit crimes to bring more profits for companies or SEX-for-CONTRACT cases (3). Ask for more TAX INCENTIVES & easy coming FINANCIAL SUPPORTS, like giving more free Tax-Payer’s money in Singapore Budget . (4). Ask to REDUCE the Quality of the work in work place, like abolish / ignore the ISO Quality standard in work place to save more cost (5). Ask to DECREASE Safety Standard to save more money (6). Ask to LOWER the professional requirement of professional jobs , like no relevant educational qualification can even take over higher positions , BUT , PAID at LOW SALARIES [ Like poorly educated Bangladeshi / Bangla workers take over the jobs of engineers & managers, BUT , paid with LOW SALARIES . This is just like Singapore in 1950s to even as early as 2000s , even little school education can also be top managers of big companies or even public-listed companies ] BUT , with the HIGH SALARIES & HIGH PROFIT MAINTAIN at the same time for these greedy bosses & top management. ANOTHER MAIN REASON is that existing employees , especially the foreigners & older staff that are less educated , & even top management are often jealous of highly educated Singaporean , Especially younger Singaporean , & scare of losing their jobs to them ,as well as, VERY IMPORTANTLY , bring about changes that can affect their “ Comfortable Life / Zone “ in work place. So the existing management & staff of companies PURPOSELY ERECT " PROTECTIONISM " in work places to create very hostile environment to kick out Singaporean employees from their jobs , like “ Bumiputera “ Policies in Malaysia . * NOTE : Singaporean Work force is regarded internationally as one of the MOSTLY HIGHLY EDUCATED & BEST in the world , so Singaporean employees can’t be that BAD or LOUSY to be justified easily to be SACK by Singapore employers Using OLD THIRD WORLD MANAGEMENT METHODS to RUN FIRST CLASS ECONOMY Definitely lead to Very Big Disaster & Destruction to our Society , our Job Security & Singapore Economy . DPM Teo had MENTION in Mass Media that Corruption has NOT BECOME A WAY of LIFE in Singapore , or have not become a kind of BAD SOCIAL CULTURES & EVIL SOCIAL VALUES in Singapore , after the Exposure of the Corruption Scandal of a senior CPIB officer. However, I am wondering why DPM Teo & Singapore Civil Service , which is BOTH the HIGHEST PAID & MOST EXPENSIVE CIVIL SERVICE in the World , have NOT CHECK on these type of BAD CORPORATE CULTURE & BAD CORPORATE VALUES have become a WAY of LIFE in Singapore Labour Market for SO MANY YEARS ? ? ? [ These usually happen in Construction Industries, Heavy Engineering Industries & other industries & companies that are HIGHLY CONSERVATIVE & LABOUR INTENSIVE , in which BOTH UNPROFESSIONALISM & UNETHICAL PRATICES have BECOME A WAY OF LIFE in the CORPORATE / INDUSTRIAL CULTURES in such industries over many years ] Don't you ALL in this Website THINK so ? ? ? Any COMMENTS from you PEOPLE out there ? ? ?

To EVERYONE in this WEBSITE, Especially to PAP , Opposition Parties , All Singaporean , Our PAP-run Singapore Government seem to have not gone in-depth to CHECK on the " QUALITIES " of both the Job Vacancies & the jobs still held by Singaporean in private sector . There are many cases that bosses only hired the Singaporean temporarily , like 1 – 6 months , & then FIRE them with all types of EXCUSES , even very Minor Ones or even Unscrupulously fabricated EXCUSES , & THEN these bosses complain to relevant authorities , like MOM , that Singaporean employees are Choosy , Bad , Lazy & etc . These bosses then make use of these “ EXCUSES ” , including Unscrupulously fabricated “ EXCUSES” , to Press the Singapore Government to allow more " Foreign Talents " to be hired by them . [ However , Often , MAIN REASONS are simply that these “ Foreign Talents “ are paid at LOW SALARIES & can ABUSE or even EXPLOIT / EAT them easily to maximize PROFITS & BENEFITS . ALSO , such foreigners are more willing to help companies to earn more money by committing CRIMES or VERY UNETHICAL ACTS , like MORE WILLING to involve in “ Sex – for - Contract “ or “ Sex – for - Favor “ activities for bosses & management , Especially China women , Filipino women & etc. . . . ANOTHER MAIN REASON is that existing employees , Especially the foreigners & older staff that are less educated , & even top management are often jealous of highly educated Singaporean , Especially younger Singaporean , & scare of losing their jobs to them , AS WELL AS , bring about changes that can affect their “ Comfortable Life / Zone “ in work place. So the existing management & staff PURPOSELY ERECT " PROTECTIONISM " in work places to create very hostile environment to kick out Singaporean employees from jobs , just like the “ Bumiputera “ Policies in Malaysia. Hence , the VERY CRUEL FACT is that the more Singaporean are better Educated & Good , the more they are going to be sacked from their jobs , due to such hidden dark sides of such employers . . . These usually happen in Construction Industries, Heavy Engineering Industries & many other industries that are Labour Intensive & Highly Conservative , in which BOTH UNPROFESSIONALISM & UNETHICAL PRATICES HAVE BECOME A WAY OF LIFE in the CORPORATE / INDUSTRIAL CULTURES in such industries over many years. ] [ TYPICAL EXAMPLE : = The Strike by the China bus drivers in 2012. These China bus drivers do this due to their POOR LIVING CONDITIONS , besides their LOW SALARIES , are a GOOD EXAMPLE on Why Companies prefer to hire " Foreign Talents " over Singaporean BECAUSE " Foreign Talents " are Cheap & ALSO can be Abuse, Exploit & Eat alive Easily , AS WELL AS , don't threaten the interests & “ Comfortable Life / Zone “ of existing staff & management Now this recent Big Riot in Little India is ANOTHER TYPICAL EXAMPLE . . . ] Using OLD THIRD WORLD MANAGEMENT METHODS to RUN FIRST CLASS ECONOMY Definitely lead to Very Big Disasters & Destruction to our Society , our Job Security & Singapore Economy . DPM Teo had MENTION in Mass Media that Corruption has NOT BECOME A WAY of LIFE in Singapore , or have not become a kind of BAD SOCIAL CULTURES & EVIL SOCIAL VALUES in Singapore , after the Exposure of the Corruption Scandal of a senior CPIB officer. However, I am wondering why DPM Teo & Singapore Civil Service , which is BOTH the HIGHEST PAID & MOST EXPENSIVE CIVIL SERVICE in the World , have NOT CHECK on these type of BAD CORPORATE CULTURE & BAD CORPORATE VALUES have become a WAY of LIFE in Singapore Labour Market for so many years ? ? ?

To EVERYONE in this WEBSITE , Especially to PAP , Opposition Parties & All Singaporean , Singapore Government MUST NOW AMEND the Existing Employment Laws & Various Systems in Singapore to PROTECT the White-Collar & Professional levels types of Singaporean employees . ( Like change the management systems of civil services & local companies , corporate cultures in Singapore , financial accounting systems to carefully track any misuse of organization's money & etc. ) , This is because such employees are the KEY FOUNDATIONs for “ High –Value Industries “ . [ Our Minister of State, Mr Teo Ser Luck , had highlighted in Public & Mass Media in world wide , of want to make Singapore society into “ Value Driven society “, BUT , BUT what is the point of saying that to us , if the Singapore Government have not done anything OR , even give the required supports . This is just like a Top Minister is announcing to public that he is strongly against Corruption in his country , BUT , at the same time , also tolerate other people in high positions to accept huge bribes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . So WHO on Earth WANT TO BELIEVE in him ? ? ? Can even FIRE him hard as VERY , VERY BIG CHEATER or BIG LIER ] The REASONS are SIMPLE ENOUGH : (1). Singapore has very Few Resources , So MANPOWER is one of our few MAIN RESOURCES that we have , to ensure our Continued Prosperity & Survival , Hence , also Must be Well-protected from HARMS & Unnecessary LOSSES . [ So how can the Organizational Cultures of “ HIRE & FIRED base on LIKE or DISLIKE “ of these Greedy Bosses & Unscrupulous Top Management be allowed any more in Singapore ? ? ? Have Ministry of Manpower or PAP-run Government stop such NON-SENSE that have existed for many year in Singapore Labour Market ? ? ? * NOTE : Singaporean Work force is internationally regarded as one of the MOSTLY HIGHLY EDUCATED & BEST in the world, so Singaporean employees can’t be that bad or lousy to be justified easily to be SACK by Singaporean employers ] (2). The Singapore Government is targeting Two / Third or about 66.7 % of entire Singaporean workforce to be White-Collar & Professional levels types of employees in near future & existing EMPLOYMENT LAWs are insufficient to protect them & their families . (3). More " Foreign Talents " are expected to enter Singaporean in future & they will harm the Benefits & Interests of many Singaporean employees , as well as, many Singaporean families . (4). So much Investment has been made in Education & Training of Singaporean to be White-collar types of workforce by Singapore & this Investment must be safe-guard well. (5). It is clear that over many years , MANY GREEDY BOSSES & UNSCRUPULOUS TOP MANAGEMENT of COMPANIES have FORCED & THREATENED Singaporean employees to commit Crimes & Very Unethical acts , just to Maximize their PROFITS or serve their own Self-Interests . [ Just like the BIG NKF Scandal in 2005 , the recent City Harvest Church scandal & Many other sensational scandals , in which the Top Managements have believe to press their employees to commit such Bad Acts So working with such types of Top Management & Leaders are Like that : " You either Become Bad like them & do what they want OR , You are Sacked from your job or WORST , they harm you for DISOBEYING their ILLEGAL / UNETHICAL / UNLAWFUL ORDERS ] (6). " High-Value Added Economy " have to rely more on highly educated professionals , especially the more trustworthy Singaporean citizens that are more loyal to Singapore than to run off to other countries when there are signs of troubles , to run this type of advance economy . Using OLD THIRD WORLD MANAGEMENT METHODS to RUN FIRST CLASS ECONOMY , Definitely lead to Very Big Disasters & Troubles to our Society & Business Environment .
