More than 275,000 jobs will be created across the region in the next six years to service , according to officials. The jobs will be in sectors linked to delivery and legacy plans for the event, from aviation and construction to retail and transportation, as part of the estimated €17.7 billion (Dh90.1 billion) expected to be generated between 2014 and 2021, said bosses at Dubai’s Expo Preparatory Committee.
To make sure the event lives up to its green credentials, a zero-emission bus service will transport visitors to and from the expo from pick-up points located at key hotel and population areas across the country.
Passengers will have their tickets checked and undergo security screening before boarding the ExpoRider. The committee added that Al Wasl Plaza, the centre of the expo, is only a 15-minute walk from any part of the site.
“To determine the most effective transport policy and planning for Expo 2020, key principles have been adopted based on detailed analysis of peak demand flows, capacity of the available infrastructure, including road network, and sustainability objectives,” said Helal Saeed Almarri, Director General of Department of Tourism & Commerce Marketing, CEO of Dubai World Trade Centre and Expo Preparatory Committee member.
