HOUSE/PALACE MANAGER-FABULOUS JOB IN ABU DHABI & DUBAI-FLAT/CAR-£3,500-6,500 PER MONTH TAX FREE
Abu Dhabi And Dubai, London
Contract type
Permanent
This is a truly fabulous opportunity for a top candidate to work as a House/Palace Manager for a HNW family.
They spend their week in Abu Dhabi and their weekends in Dubai.
You must be prepared to work a six day week when needed (they travel quite a lot), or go with to Dubai,
but your time off will be spent in your own flat which will allow you to experience all that this part of the world has to offer.
Due to cultural reasons it is likely that this job will be offered to a female candidate.
However, Abu Dhabi and Dubai have very few restrictions on women and you are allowed to drive, go out etc. and there is quite a large ex pat community to be friends with.
Your role will mean that you are entirely responsible for the general running of the household with regard to the housekeeping and presentation of the properties used by the family. You will need to be someone who can communicate well with people from all cultures as you will need to make sure that everything is prepared and presented for where the family visit and live.
In addition you will be involved in the organisation of parties and social events, organising contractors, keeping budgets and making sure that invoicing is in order, negotiation with the housekeeping manager, security, etc. in order to make sure that all the families arrangements and requirements are met.
This is a job that will give you a fabulous lifestyle and an amazing opportunity, but it is not for the faint hearted!
There are times when this job will be very busy and very demanding - so working well under pressure is needed as will be excellent communication skills and the ability to organise a team of people to work with you as well as for you.
Your work experience will show that you have successfully worked for at least 3 years as a House Manager for a HNW family and are looking for an opportunity to 'step up the career ladder', or candidates who have worked for the same length of time in senior Hotel Management will also be considered if you feel your skills would fit into a private household setting. Although a driver will be available for your own use most of the time you will also need to be able to drive yourself in order to have the freedom to go out when you are not working.
Your accommodation would be your own flat away from the family compound in Abu Dhabi and private suite accommodation in Dubai.
A car will also be made available. Sorry but your cannot take partners, pets or children with you.
The salary will reflect your work experience but will be in the region of £3,500 to £6,500 sterling tax free per month.
Please note that we can only accept applications with a CV attached.
