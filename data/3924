Product
Kanari was born out of the belief that restaurants do much more than sell food - they create experiences for people. We’ve found that those businesses that are able to create experiences people love do so by virtue of their ability to tune-in to their customers.
They don’t just claim to value customer feedback. They ask for it, study it and then do all they can to act on it. Indeed, these businesses treat customer feedback as an asset. An asset that they use to build great, long-lasting relationships with their customers. It sounds easy but developing these relationships takes commitment, time and effort. We built Kanari to help.
Kanari is a cloud-based platform that allows businesses to collect, track and analyze customer experience data. With our mobile survey, simple rewards mechanism and user-friendly analytics, Kanari empowers businesses to figure out what and where they need to improve in order to build true customer satisfaction and genuine customer loyalty.
Why Us?
Kanari is young but it is growing quickly. If the idea of joining a small-but-experienced team working to solve a real-world problem with cutting edge technology appeals to you then we want to hear from you. We promise you that the ride won't be an easy one, but it will certainly be fun... So, if you're talented and you understand what it means to be a part of a startup then get in touch!
