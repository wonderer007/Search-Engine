Singapore's first community-led job placement centre celebrated its 10th anniversary on Saturday with a one-day recruitment fair.
More than 1,000 jobs in various industries were on offer at Project Success's booths at the Pasir Ris Elias Community Club. The project's name stands for "Singaporeans united as a community to care and to encourage self-sufficiency".
It has directly placed 3,700 people in jobs since 2004, and also helps to refer people who need financial assistance to the right places.
The project is a collaboration between Pasir Ris-Punggol Citizens' Consultative Committees, the North East Community Development Council, Pasir Ris-Punggol Town Council and is supported by the Singapore Workforce Development Agency.
