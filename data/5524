John Kerry is Israel's best friend. Seriously. He's not the
kind of friend whom you're going to call to play Frisbee with in the park, plan your
bachelor party, or be there for you after a nasty breakup.
Israel has lots of those kinds of friends. They're the ones
who tell it what it wants to hear or come to its defense when other people say
harsh (but true) things about it. These people call themselves the "pro-Israel
community."
Kerry's a better friend than that.
He's the kind of friend who will cut you off at the bar when
you've had enough to drink or who will step in and prevent you from getting in a
fight. In the case of Israel, he's the friend who's not afraid to speak some
unpleasant truths about the dark future that could be facing the Jewish state --
as the U.S. secretary of state did this weekend in raising the specter of Israel becoming a
if no peace agreement with the Palestinians is achieved.
Alas, with the deadline for the Kerry talks to end having now
come and gone, Israel has failed to heed the wise counsel of its good friend.
In the process, its leaders are making a historic and catastrophic mistake
that will quite possibly doom Israel to a near-term future of isolation,
delegitimization, and violence.
Things did not have to be this way.
Nine months ago, when Kerry's quixotic peace effort began,
Israel could not have been in a better position: a weakened Palestinian national
movement helmed by a leader more committed than any other in Palestinian
history to a two-state solution, a neutralized Hamas, a
among Palestinians for armed struggle, and an Arab world willing, even eager, to
end the conflict. After the constant drumbeat of suicide terrorism in 2002 and
2003, Israel is enjoying a rare period of sustained peace and security. While
Israelis remain skeptical about the potential for a permanent solution, a large
percentage of the country continues to support a two-state solution and -- as
after
shows --
to make concessions in the pursuit of peace.
Perhaps above all, the Israelis had a friend in Kerry
willing to bend over backward to pacify Israel's security concerns.
Yet the response of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was not
to embrace the possibility for peace, but to consistently and flagrantly undercut
it. For example, the United States convinced the Palestinians to put aside
their demand that Israel end settlement construction in the West Bank as a
precondition to begin talks and instead accept the release of Palestinian
prisoners from Israeli jails. What was Bibi's response? According to a
from the settlement watchdog group Peace Now, the Israeli government has, since
the talks began, approved the construction of 14,000 more settler homes in the
West Bank and Jerusalem. Netanyahu seemingly has gone out of his way to stick a
sharp pencil in Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas's eye (while also
standing largely silent as members of his own cabinet publicly disrespected
Kerry).
Public conciliation efforts by Abbas -- like
of an extended Israeli presence in the Jordan Valley, publicly
waiving his own right of return, or last week
-- should have been welcomed by Israeli
leaders. Instead they were trivialized, , or ignored. No serious effort was made by Bibi to
prepare the Israeli public for the possibility of peace, as is constantly demanded
by Israelis of Palestinian leaders. Instead, Netanyahu and his right-wing
minions continuously disparaged Abbas as a partner for peace and put more and
more obstacles in the way of a potential deal.
While Abbas's decision to seek international recognition and
later strike a unity deal with Hamas had the nominal effect of throwing a
monkey wrench in the negotiations, he has made a far more serious effort to find
common ground. Netanyahu's apparent strategy has been to wring as many concessions
-- no matter how minor -- out of his Palestinian interlocutors while offering nothing
but bluster in return. It's zero-sum peacemaking, and it has blown up in his face --
because unlike in the past, there isn't going to be any question about who will
get blamed when yet another round of Arab-Israeli peace talks falls apart.
Indeed, one of the more striking developments over the past
few weeks is how much more nimble and effective Palestinian diplomacy has been
in comparison to that of Israel. For much of the past year, Abbas was forced to
withstand Netanyahu's constant humiliations, wary of being blamed if talks fell
apart. But in March, as the prospect of the failure of the talks increased, U.S.
pressure on Israel grew, and Netanyahu refused to abide by previously agreed-upon commitments to . Abbas responded aggressively. He sought entry into ; he reached a ; he refused to walk away from negotiations, even going so far as
to meet Bibi "at any place and at any time." "We salute the American efforts," , "but Israel is procrastinating."
Abbas clearly was not content to sit on his hands. Instead,
he has run diplomatic circles around the flat-footed Israelis, who have responded
by rolling out the same, barely credible talking points blaming the
Palestinians for "" that doomed the talks (as if unceasing settlement construction
builds trust between both sides).
All of this leaves Israel in a terrible spot.
Palestinian efforts to gain international recognition -- which
could, ominously for Israel, include the International Criminal Court -- are going to create a diplomatic wildfire for Israel. The United States has long
carried water for Israel in international forums like the United Nations, but this
could prove increasingly difficult. As President Barack Obama , "If you see no peace deal and
continued aggressive settlement construction … if Palestinians come to believe that the
possibility of a contiguous, sovereign Palestinian state is no longer within
reach, then our ability to manage the international fallout is going to be
limited."
Obama's words are another harbinger of troubles ahead for
the Israelis. When one factors in Obama's inclination to pursue a nuclear deal
with Iran (against the strident opposition of Israel), ,
and the evident frustration among American diplomats over the apparent failure
of the current peace talks, we seem to be entering a period of frostier U.S.-Israel
relations.
Far worse for Israel, however, will likely be the economic
fallout. Over the past year, a movement to boycott, divest from, and sanction
(BDS) Israel over its policies in the West Bank has gathered steam. It began
in July 2013 when the European Union offered new
that prohibit EU money from partnering with entities that operate east of
the 1967 lines in occupied Palestinian territory. A number of
have followed suit. Notable academics such as Stephen Hawking and
musicians like Roger Waters and others have also heeded calls to boycott
Israel. It's hard to imagine the BDS effort not ramping up if the talks
officially break down.
As Israeli Finance Minister Yair Lapid noted , a "European boycott" will affect Israeli trade relations with
its largest trading partner and mean a higher cost of living, a reduced
national budget, and potentially up to 10,000 lost jobs.
Then there is the security side. For the past several years, the
Israeli government has outsourced security
in the West Bank and administration of the occupation to the Palestinian
Authority, which has by all accounts performed admirably in preventing renewed
violence against Israelis. How long will that continue in the absence of any
negotiating path toward a Palestinian state?
For Israelis, there is a widely held view that the status
quo can be maintained ad infinitum.
That may very well be true -- until it's not true anymore. Yes, it's possible
that in the near term nothing much will change: that Palestinian efforts to
delegitimize Israel will fail, that the BDS movement will crash and burn, that
the U.S.-Israel relationship will remain unchanged, and that Israel will
somehow be able to maintain its democratic character even as it rules over a
majority population of Palestinians who lack full political rights.
Or, it will no
longer be possible -- and if that happens, Israel will be desperately seeking a
friend to help it out of the hole it has dug.
Indeed, it's precisely this possibility and the uncertainty of what
happens next that should be most worrisome to Israelis. A peace agreement right
now -- no matter how painful to accept -- is the most certain path for the
Jewish state. That's what Israel's best friend has been trying to tell them for
the past year. Kerry has given Israel an exit ramp -- and the country's leaders have ignored
it.
When all is said and done, John Kerry may face personal
embarrassment at the failure of his peace process gambit, but it's Israel that
will experience the real tragedy.
