Description
This is a Head Chef job that’s both highly demanding and highly rewarding. Our client is one of the Middle East’s premier high concept restaurant designer/operator and this will be one of their flagship restaurant concepts. Heavily seafood orientated (although not exclusively so, vegetarian, meat & poultry items will feature too) this restaurant is one of the Gulf’s most keenly anticipated openings and you could be its new Head Chef.
The operation is split over several floors and will feature unique offerings at every level. It will successfully combine European, Mediterranean and Asian concepts and as Head Chef you’ll need to have familiarity with these cuisines while bringing to the table an expertise in Seafood Cookery. Seafood expertise is the core culinary competency sought in a Head Chef for this position.
Applicants will additionally be recognised as, and have a demonstrable track record in leadership positions in high end, high volume kitchens. Put plainly this is a position for proven achievers and so we cannot consider applications from Chefs who haven’t previous experience as a Head Chef in such a role.
This business is centred around one upmarket seafood restaurant/brasserie with more specialist niche offerings in the lounge area and elsewhere. The ability, and willingness, to manage, train and mentor, a large (approx 50) multicultural  Kitchen Staff is essential to the success of this business and we’ll need to be convinced beyond the slightest doubt of your abilities in this area before we can recommend you to our clients for this position. Ideally you’ll also have experience in new openings. English is the lingua franca used in this kitchen so you’ll need fluency in both its spoken and written forms.
In addition to the salary there is an excellent ex-pat package to include private medical insurance (family plan), annual flights and high end accommodation.
Because we’ll need to have the successful applicant on the ground at least two months before opening, and because we know interest in this job will be intense, we encourage you to apply for this position without delay.
Due to the sheer volume of CVs we handle we cannot, in all cases, promise an immediate personal response and will be prioritising those applications which closely match the requirements requested by our clients.

Don’t See The Right Chef Job For You?
We don’t advertise every Chef Job we’re working on because we often have the right chef on our Chef Database already and so advertising the Chef Job here on our own Jobs Board, or elsewhere, is both unnecessary duplicates our work. That’s why we encourage you to use the form below to send us your Chef CV, or Resume, so that you’re on our database; that makes it easier for us to find and contact you when the right chef job does arrive on our desk.
