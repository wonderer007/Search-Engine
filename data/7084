SINGAPORE: Residents of Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC will now be able to get more help in their job search or other forms of social assistance through a new one-stop service point.Project S.U.C.C.E.S.S, which has been assisting residents with jobs, will integrate its work processes with a Social Service Office located opposite Sengkang Community Club.Project S.U.C.C.E.S.S was a collaboration between the Pasir Ris-Punggol Citizens' Consultative Committees, the North East Community Development Council, the Pasir Ris-Punggol Town Council and supported by the Singapore Workforce Development Agency.Speaking at the 10th anniversary of the project, Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean said such programmes help to create more job opportunities for seniors who are healthy and want to continue to work.This is timely as the government supports raising the re-employment age beyond 65.49-year-old Tay Swee Chuan lost his job after he suffered a slipped disc, and for six months, his search in finding light duty work was futile.He was then introduced to Project S.U.C.C.E.S.S and was matched to a part-time position as a car park attendant.After his condition improved, he was offered a full-time position as a security officer at the Marina Country Club.Mr Tay said: "I was looking in the newspapers and all the jobs (listed were) not suitable for me. I (felt) very frustrated and depressed. Then I went to Project S.U.C.C.E.S.S for help. I feel very happy because at least it solved my financial problems."Like Mr Tay, some 4000 others have been successfully placed in jobs under the programme which started in 2004.Mr Teo said: "What we are trying to do is to help those who may be affected by restructuring of the economy as well as specific groups who may have a little more difficulty finding jobs, particularly those who are older or those who have physical disabilities."Its upcoming social service centre, slated to be open in June by the Social and Family Development Ministry, will provide job assistance in addition to social assistance.This collaboration will be the first of its kind in Singapore.A full-time staff will be placed within the Social Service Office to assist residents.Mr Teo said: "We find that quite a number of residents, they have quite a range of issues which they need help in. Finding a job is one of the basic things because it helps with their income and support for their family. But in the meantime they may have other issues -- healthcare or somebody who's elderly and sick at home, may be the reasons why they are not working.“We want to give them a more wrap around care ability so Project S.U.C.C.E.S.S. will help them in job skills and job placement, whereas the Social Service Office can help them with the other aspects of the family and the issues that they may face."A recruitment drive was held as part of the celebrations with more than 1,000 positions available.Among some of the companies that are participating in the recruitment drive are McDonald's Restaurant and NTUC FairPrice. Meanwhile, Resorts World Sentosa has the most jobs on offer.
