In terms of its direct GDP, travel and tourism is slightly smaller than the size of the financial services sector in the UAE.Employment In 2012, the estimated total contribution of UAE travel and tourism to employment was 383,500 jobs, representing 11.3% of total employment, as compared to 363,100 jobs in 2011. This is forecast to increase by 2.6% in 2013 to 393,500 jobs.Over the next 10 years, the sector is expected to create 245,000 jobs directly by 2023 registering average annual growth rate of about 4.1%. This includes employment by hotels, travel agents, airlines and other passenger transportation services; it also includes the activities of the restaurant and leisure industries directly supported by tourists (see Figure 3.)Source: Dubai Chamber based on WTTCBenchmarking tourism and travel sector to other sectors employment, it is found that the sector directly employs more people than the auto manufacturing, financial services, communications, mining and chemical manufacturing sectors.InvestmentUAE travel and tourism sector is estimated to have attracted capital investment of about AED 82.8 billion in 2012. This value is expected to rise by 11.7% in 2013 and to grow annually on average by 4.5% over the next 10 years to reach AED143.4 billion in 2023.

The main challenge is to achieve sustained growth which will entail developing new approaches to tourism market.The biggest economic transformation that the UAE and Dubai are witnessing with the expanding tourism activity will lead to increased consumers spending and necessitates investment booms in the buildings and infrastructure that is needed to be carried out with great efficiency to ensure lucrative returns while maintaining competitiveness.
