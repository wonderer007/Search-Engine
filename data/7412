Why join SG Tutors and not another tuition agency
At SG Tutors we are often asked why an aspiring tuition teacher should choose to work with us instead of another more established tuition agency. That's a fair question. The reason is simple ... "SG Tutors was set-up by a tutor for tutors."
How it all started was when my wife decided to give tuition on the side to keep herself busy. Like most tutors, she joined an agency and each time she got an assignment, the tuition agency took half of the first month's fee. This happened each and every time she got an assignment. And as any tutor can tell you, it adds up. Especially, close to exam periods where parents only want you for 1 or 2 months.
Being an entrepreneur myself, I do not begrudge the tuition agencies. They afterall have their costs and are profit-driven companies. I therefore worked with my wife to create a system where the tutors were taken care of and we were rewarded for our time and effort. And this was how SG Tutors was born.
As a fixed-fee tuition agency, tutors pay us a one-time to be listed on our database for life. Thereafter, any and all fees earned by the tuition teacher is for the tuition teacher to keep. As a single listing can generate multiple assignments, we believe that SG Tutors has the "cheapest" agency fees in the Singapore market. SG Tutors job is thus to drive traffic to the site which we do using SEO and other social media campaigns.
The question some might then ask is how does SG Tutors generate revenue. Our profit model comes from 2 sources. Firstly, the listing fee which we charge tutors and, secondly, advertising revenue we generate from selling ad space (and products) for ancillary services. By operating as a blogsite, SG Tutors keeps our cost low and hence us profitable.
Thus, if you are a Singapore tuition teacher looking for a tuition agency to work with, do consider joining the agency with the best assignment fees in town. You can contact us using the form at the right column of this page.
