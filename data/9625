Program Background
The Knowledge Sector Initiative (KSI) program is a joint initiative between the Australian Government and BAPPENAS (The National Planning Agency) to improve the quality of public policies in Indonesia through the use of research, analysis and evidence. The program seeks to achieve this by supporting the capacity building of policy research institutes (the supply side), to improve the quality of their research to meet policy maker’s needs, improve systems and regulations in government to support research-based policy making, and to develop effective models for procuring and using research to strengthen policies in education, health and social protection that will benefit the country’s poor (the demand side), and working with various intermediary organisations involved in making research-based evidence accessible to policy makers including civil society organisations and the media (intermediaries). The program, projected to be 15 years in duration, started implementation in May 2013.
The overall goal of KSI is that Indonesia has the capacity to develop effective and socially accountable policies that meet priority development needs. Revitalizing the Indonesian knowledge sector is an enormous effort, well beyond the scope of any one agency or development partner. DFAT’s objective in supporting this program is to catalyse reform efforts by providing its partners with a framework and resources to drive a reform process. It does not do everything. Designing the program interventions required striking a balance between the need for a comprehensive approach to knowledge sector reform and realism about what can be achieved with limited capacities, resources, and timeframes. Nevertheless, analysis suggests that in Indonesia the time is ripe for launching this change.
The KSI implementation team is led by a Team Leader, with a Lead Technical Adviser, and Senior Advisers for each of the three main components (supply, demand and intermediaries). The Senior Adviser, Evaluation and Organizational Learning (EOL) will lead on these two essential cross-cutting components, which due to the focus of the initiative as a whole on capacity development of all stakeholders, are very closely related. Other senior managers are already in place for finance and administration, grants, and communications.
