Aladdin's Success Story
I have a series of success stories with Bayt.com. Bayt.com was helpful two times not to mention the tens of interviews which I made. Because of this I was able to choose the best opportunities.
Bayt.com also helped me rewrite my CV. I did not know before that how to highlight my skills in a top professional way until I joined the CV writing service from Bayt.com.
I worked in Dubai with Khalifa Al-Nabooda Group as GM for Jos Hansen & Zoehen (Golf). Later I worked with Alghanim Industrial Group as Regional Manager in KSA and Bahrain.
Thanks to Bayt.com for these two opportunities.
Now,
I am a business partner in KSA . I am an Executive Manager for the company. I will ask for Bayt.com's help for recruiting my staff very soon.

shafeek's Success Story
I joined Bayt.com four years ago in 2008 when one of my friends advised me to register my CV on Bayt.com. I was working in a local company then and my salary and position were not that good. I was dreaming to start my life anew so I thought of taking a step forward and looking for a new job. I didn't believe that I would find a job that easily through a job-site,
but the miracle happened- an employer found my CV on Bayt.com and I was later hired. Now I'm working in a big organization and I have a lot of knowledge and experience under my belt. Because of Bayt.com,
my life has changed.Thank you Bayt.com for what I have now as I feel all my dreams have been fulfilled.

Mohamed's Success Story
Hi,
I have been using Bayt.com for the past 4 years as a default employment & recruiting website.
I improved my CV many times because of Bayt.com services. I Actually improved my whole methodology about the employment market because of Bayt.com as I realized how competitive the market is becoming !
Each time I see any job requirement I compare it to my skills,
do I do that? do I need to do or learn how to do that in order to get this job?
With time I prepared a more professional CV and I tried to gain new skills and experiences to be able to properly fit good working opportunities.
Being a jobseeker registered on Bayt.com,
I started receiving many job offers through this great website.
This year,
the recruiting department at Obeikan called me to for an interview as a candidate for the position of Office Manager for the group Vice President,
and Alhamdu-Lillah I won the position.
My new working place is totally different from the previous one,
specially since I made a great jump from the low management level to the top management level.
New amazing experience that I enjoy every moment.
Really,
Thanks Bayt.com

Shujauddin's Success Story
In December 2007 I came to Kuwait with a dream to find a good job to get my family to live with me,
but the market at that time was very tough. There were many jobs out there but what I was looking for a job in a leading firm. I dropped my CV to many places and I got good interview calls but still I was not able to find the right job.
Later a good friend of mine advised me to register on Bayt.com and I did. On February 25th 2008 I saw an advertisement on Bayt.com posted by Tawasul Telecom for a Call Center Executive,
I found the company interesting and I applied for the job.
On March 1st I gave the interview and I was selected to work in the company from March 15th 2008. Now I am promoted to NOC engineer and successfully completed 4 years in the company,
my family is also living here with me which gives me immense pleasure.
Thanks Bayt.com for your help.

Yasir's Success Story
I was working as a Senior Network Engineer in Pakistan's largest Service Provider Mobilink BCD/LINKdotNET,then one of my friends in KSA gave me a suggestion to apply for GCC jobs through Bayt.com. I did not believe in job portals before this incident and said to him "Its a wastage of time to go through job portals everyday and spend my precious time as they really don't reply back and just advertise jobs". He told me to just apply through Bayt.com and they will take care of my time and career path .I applied upon his suggestion and I got a response from the employer telling me that you applied on Bayt.com. I could not believe and after a successful telephonic interview I got the job as a Network Engineer in KFUPM King Fahad University of Petroleum and Minerals KSA in March 2013.I am really thankful to Bayt.com to make my dreams come true in this very easy way. I recommend every professional to make a profile on Bayt.com and apply from this leading Middle East Job Portal.
Kind Regards,
