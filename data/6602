JOB DETAILS
Teach Away is looking for experienced, motivated and internationally-minded teachers to participate in an exciting education reform in this affluent region of the UAE.
The government of Abu Dhabi has dedicated itself to helping their students be competitive internationally through increased proficiency in English with a focus on the core subjects of math, science and English. With this, international teaching jobs are now available for Native English speaking Kindergarten - Grade 5 teachers to grow this program from the ground up.
As Kindergarten schools are female staffed, only female applicants can be considered for Kindergarten teaching jobs. All applicants must be native English speakers, and able to attend an in-person interview in North America, the UK, Ireland, South Africa, Australia, or New Zealand.
