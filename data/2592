Hope you can help.
I am a published fitness model trainer and holistic nutritionist. I am looking for someone
who can assist in boosting & developing my brand online through social media such as Facebook, Google, Twitter
and Instagram etc. Ideally I need someone who can put it all together for me and get it up and running. I can't pay much but I can definitely send business your way with a great reference. I would prefer to work with those who are looking for experience, to get a reference, who are based in Dubai.
Please no companies!
Feel free to ask any questions through the Nabbesh workflow.
Thanks
Anita
