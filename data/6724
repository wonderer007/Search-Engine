FANR hosts Sharjah Public Forum

The Federal authority for nuclear regulation (FANR) hosted its sixth public forum at Sharjah University City Hall amid a number of officials from the media, government and private sectors in the UAE.
As with other FANR forums, FANR hosted this forum with the aim of introducing to the residents of Sharjah and Ajman FANR’s role in ensuring the safe, secure and peaceful uses of the nuclear energy in the UAE.
“We are encouraging residents of Sharjah and Ajman to be aware of the UAE’s peaceful nuclear power programme and in particular to be aware of FANR’s role in nuclear safety, security and safeguards” said Dr William Travers, FANR’s Director General. “FANR is using world experts to work alongside Emirati engineers to guarantee high competence and the long-term sustainability of FANR’s work.”
FANR is working closely with its strategic partners in Sharjah and Ajman including the headquarters of both Sharjah and Ajman police, the Civil Defence and the customs authorities of both emirates amongst others to engage with its stakeholders and showcase its full commitment to transparency and sustainability.
The forum was held by FANR’s officials representing various departments in the organisation. The attendees were able to ask questions about FANR’s regulatory work, scholarship and employment opportunities, and its responsibility within the nuclear programme.
At the end of the forum the audience had the opportunity to ask FANR’s officials questions.
FANR plans to conduct another public forum in Ras Al Khaimah, Umm Al Quwain and Fujairah in the last quarter of 2014.
