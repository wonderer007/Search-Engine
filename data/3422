About Us
TLTP Teach Global is an international education recruitment consultancy, assisting native English speaking candidates to secure opportunities overseas teaching a range of academic subjects as well as English as a Foreign Language (EFL). Our company is based in London, UK and consists of knowledgeable employees from the education recruitment industry with a combined business experience that spans over 30 years.
We provide a recruitment solution that is tailored to our clients’ requirements. We realise that each employer works at a different pace, requires specific candidate documents and prefers their own unique interview process. We pride ourselves on providing a quality service, speaking to all available teachers and clearly explaining everything they need to know about each opportunity and package on offer.
The success rate of our teachers fulfilling their contracts is second to none. We attribute this success to our ensuring that all candidates are made fully aware of all aspects of the employment opportunity. This includes the teaching environment they will be expected to work in, the full details of the package on offer, through to general living conditions in the specific location of the project. Our experience has taught us there are many important factors prospective candidates need to consider before undertaking a teaching position overseas.
