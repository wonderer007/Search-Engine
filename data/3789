Full-Time

Description:
The Company:
A privately owned, $3bn turnover Dubai based Group with interests in oil & gas, construction and development. The business is mostly downstream oil & gas currently (they own a large oil refinery and a fleet of oil tankers) but also a big construction and development focus, as they own a lot of land in the Middle East region. They are now looking to significantly expand their operations to generate more revenue with the long term aim of branching out into upstream as well to realise the oil potential from their land, and they are in the process of trying to secure $1bn of private equity investment for this expansion, with the potential long term aim to list on the LSE. Due to this need for external investment they are having to reshape their Finance function, and have recently bought in a Group Finance Director with an multinational background to lead this process.
The Role:
One of the new roles that has been signed off is this position for Senior Finance Manager, a highly commercial role with good exposure to M&A work, managing a team of 2 qualified accountants and reporting directly to the FD.
There is a roughly equal split between business-as-usual reporting and project related work here. This would cover:
- Supervising the Trade Accounting process for the sale of the Oil to the commodities markets- Managing the Shipping Accountant, who looks after the finances for the fleet of Oil Tankers- Accounting for the Private Jet for the Group CEO- Modelling ROI and due diligence work around potential acquisitions, also possibly for the potential IPO- Cost forecasting and modelling, and after sign-off project accounting for potential large CapEx projects, for example further Oil Tanker purchases or the extensive planned expansion of the Refinery
The Candidate:
You could be from a big 4 transaction services background with good relevant industry exposure, or else have worked in-house in a similar capacity. The main requirements are:
- Strong expertise in financial modelling- Good exposure to the M&A cycle either from an internal function of a large blue-chip or in an advisory capacity from Big4 practice or similar- Some exposure to the commodities markets, and an understanding of trade accounting - Must have fluent English, a western national is preferred- Some experience working in the Middle East or other developing countries would be ideal- Previous experience of working through an IPO process would be beneficial
The Reward:Salary would be c. 10K USD per month, tax free, with some benefits on top but not including accommodation.
There is good future potential future progression here, and the opportunity to be part of a fast evolving business that is growing incredibly quickly - effectively you could be reporting directly to the Group FD of a listed plc in as little as 2-3 years! It will almost certainly become and internationally recognised brand if they can do things right and secure the investment they need, and therefore an excellent employer name for the CV!
