Regulator in Dubai makes first award under accreditation scheme for energy services companies
: Wednesday, April 30 - 2014 @ 12:19
Dubai’s electricity and water regulator, the RSB, has announced its first award under the accreditation scheme developed for energy service companies to MAF Dalkia.
The award comes in line with the Regulatory & Supervisory Bureau (RSB)’s role to implement the Green Economy strategy in Dubai as well as the Dubai Integrated Energy Strategy 2030, supporting Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) to assess energy use in Dubai’s buildings and make them more energy efficient.
HE Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Vice Chairman of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, said, “Our accreditation scheme reflects the direction set by HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, the energy strategy adopted by the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, which aims to increase energy efficiency in Dubai by 30% by 2030, as well as the UAE’s Vision 2021. We are continuously working on Dubai’s sustainability path and ensuring Dubai becomes a global example of energy security and efficiency, as well as a leader of investments in renewable energy and reduced carbon emissions.”
HE added, “The ESCO accreditation scheme was launched earlier this year and highlighted the importance of regulatory frameworks that encourage and support partnerships with the private sector that aim to create new business and investment opportunities to contribute to transforming Dubai into a smart and sustainable city.” Lastly, HE noted, “I look forward to other companies joining MAF Dalkia as accredited ESCOs to transform Dubai’s current buildings into energy saving ones.”
Commenting on the award, the RSB’s Chairman, HE Ali bin Abdullah Al Owais, said, “This award is an important milestone in the delivery of Dubai’s target of raising energy efficiency. Companies such as MAF Dalkia have an essential role to play in improving the energy performance of Dubai’s buildings. With an estimated 30,000 buildings to be retrofitted to save energy and water between now and 2030 we need experienced, qualified energy service companies to offer their services to building owners in the commercial, government and residential sectors.”
Alex Mussallam, CEO of MAF Dalkia commented, “MAF Dalkia’s ESCO accreditation is a significant milestone that reaffirms our commitment to sustainability and energy management and its timing comes in line with many energy diversification projects. “MAF Dalkia will continue to support the nation’s sustainable development targets and deliver energy efficient projects which include the rational use of energy and water. Its unique approach to Building Energy Services relies on a combination of powerful energy data analysis tools derived from more than 70 years of experience in energy management, with on-site teams trained to deliver optimised operations and maintenance programs,” he added.
