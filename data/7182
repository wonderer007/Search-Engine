Sembcorp Waste Truck Driver. Saw this in the paper the other day, the guy earns $3k a month. Good enough to support his family of 2 kids and a wife.
Huge Crane Operator. I don't know the proper term for it, but it's one of those giant-ass cranes and not the smaller kind. Think of the biggest ones you see and that's it. It can get you $4-$4.5k if I'm not wrong. But such jobs requires a fair bit of experience and some technical expertise, so its something you have to be trained for. Also the chances of emergency toilet breaks on the job are slim to none.
Working at these jobs don't require much paper qualifications, and are decent enough for a person to apply for loans and buy their own house, sustain their own family. Are there any others like that?

I think the SembCorp driver in the video is the same guy that I read about in the paper. This is a very good video, thanks!

T 4 points5 points6 points 3 days ago T 4 points5 points6 points 3 days agoDrug dealer. Singapore's incredibly strict prohibition laws drive up the prices of drugs to a ridiculous level. I remember hearing about how a dealer would be able to make about 200% profit on most of the stuff he sold.
5 points6 points7 points 3 days ago  5 points6 points7 points 3 days agoIts either 200% profit or gantung. :)

T 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago T 1 point2 points3 points 3 days agoObviously you don't smuggle and deal at the same time. He probably got them from a source that smuggled, or buys from a middleman. He's definitely not seeing all the money. Drugs pass through many hands before they end up being sold.
The drug industry is a complicated one, just as complicated as any other. Here's
going into some of the details. I don't know of any videos illustrating the South East Asian drug industry so this is all I got. Pretty sure there is a similar system set up here.

really tough work.. quit just one month lol since i'm enlisting like 2 months later.
0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago  0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoTruck driver. The guys who drive trucks that move sand from the Tampines to other areas in Singapore make about 80-120 bucks a trip. A friend's brother once made close to 4k in a month. Averages about 3k.
2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago*  2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago*I concur on the truck driver. Especially Trailer driver (Class 4).
Prices I have seen so far with basic pay of $0-600/mth,
Each delivery is around $35-$65 (depending on the chassis size and item)
Post-delivery, returning of an empty chassis is around $15-$20 (again, dependent on size; for example a low bed, wide chassis is usually worth more)
Moving of chassis in loading bay/warehouse is $10-$20/hr
Waiting for loading $10/hr (depends on the company. If the driver has no basic pay, waiting time is paid for)
It can go higher but I ain't telling you how high it can go. These are the current average.
If you make about the minimum 3 trips per day, you can net about 2-3k easily. Usually if you do 3 trips, you'll probably finish work at 5 or 6pm if there are no waiting during delivery.
But the cons are:
Reporting time can start as early as 7.30am but work starts at 8.30am cause the factories open at that time. You got to be early to catch as many jobs as possible! Early bird catches the juiciest worm!
Some construction site requires a lot of waiting! Waiting during delivery is not paid! So sometimes drivers do leave chassis at the side of the road and leave if it takes too damn long. Hence why you'll see some abandoned chassis at the side of construction sites.
It can get very tiring especially if you're driving the old truck with gears, no power steering and very very limp suspension. However nowadays, many companies has trailer trucks that comes with auto gear and power steering! So you might get lucky.
If the controller hates you or you don't get along with him/her, say bye bye to your rice bowl.
Why do the low and wide bed chassis cost more? Cause you can't drive on the expressway. Going from Tuas to Changi? Good luck navigating through neighbourhoods. Want to go on expressways? You got to pay for Cisco escorts and usually companies don't unless it's urgent.
There are many more details but if you have some self-discipline and are hard working, I have seen drivers earning upwards of 6k. One PRC guy broke record by earning 7+k. I swear that guy doesn't sleep or something.
Oh by the way, sand trucks are definitely not where the money is at because sand trucks involves a lot a lot of waiting. Time is money! Trailers trailers trailers!
Source: I work with trailer drivers. Control 'em like little toy cars.
Bishan 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago Bishan 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agothose low loaders that transport cars for showrooms etc also earn quite a lot of money, however the long work hours and unreliable timing in shift takes a toll on the body
0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago  0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoCrane operators can earn a very decent amount, but with OT. And yes, toilet breaks are done at operator's console (that's what the plastic bags are for).
Protip: Don't wander too near them when they're in operation.
0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago  0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoYou can make something like 4k sgd a month if you
