- Friday, May 2, 2014 Refuse truck driver, quay crane operator or being the person who maintains train tracks while Singapore sleeps. These are some of the less popular and recognised jobs in the city-state highlighted in a touching and eye-opening Labour Day tribute video titled “”, which was done by a group of filmmakers called . While Labour Day may mean going on a short getaway or catching up with the family for some, the cinematographers used the occasion to spread awareness about such local workers in Singapore. “We pledge to stand with workers of Singapore” they said at the end of the meaningful video. Those who pledge to do the same can show their support by sharing the 5 minute 39 second clip on social media. The video has garnered close to 40,000 views in just two days since it was uploaded onto YouTube on Wednesday. The video was also screened at a May Day rally in Singapore, said a video commenter.

20 comments Singaporeans are not the only ones shunning dirty smelly jobs. Nobody in any country loves doing such jobs Cheap foreign labour take up dirty smelly jobs in Singapore not because they like the jobs or they love Singapore so much that they sacrifice everything to make Singapore clean and green. They take up the jobs shunned by Singaporeans because they could not find any job at home even for half the pay they can get in their own countries. They certainly would like to work in air-conditioned room like our ministers, lunch in air-conditioned canteen. But their countries cannot provide them jobs and they are not even able to fake or afford a fake a degree to land them white-collared jobs in Singapore.

At the opening of the Devan Nair Institute for Employment and Employability (TST 2 May), PM Lee sets up his goal : Better workers, jobs and lives, and pledges the government will do all it can to improve Singaporeans' lives. We would prefer the goal to be increase workers' pays, job satisfaction and less stressful lives. His pledge, the government will do all it can to improve Singaporeans' lives (by allowing them to work well beyond 75)! Singaporeans here include permanent residents?

To EVERYONE in this WEBSITE, Especially to PAP , Opposition Parties , All Singaporean , Our PAP-run Singapore Government seem to have not gone in-depth to CHECK on the " QUALITIES " of both the Job Vacancies & the jobs still held by Singaporean in private sector . There are many cases that bosses only hired the Singaporean temporarily , like 1 – 6 months , & then FIRE them with all types of EXCUSES , even very Minor Ones or even Unscrupulously fabricated EXCUSES , & THEN these bosses complain to relevant authorities , like MOM , that Singaporean employees are Choosy , Bad , Lazy & etc . These bosses then make use of these “ EXCUSES ” , including Unscrupulously fabricated “ EXCUSES” , to Press the Singapore Government to allow more " Foreign Talents " to be hired by them . [ However , Often , MAIN REASONS are simply that these “ Foreign Talents “ are paid at LOW SALARIES & can ABUSE or even EXPLOIT / EAT them easily to maximize PROFITS & BENEFITS . ALSO , such foreigners are more willing to help companies to earn more money by committing CRIMES or VERY UNETHICAL ACTS , like MORE WILLING to involve in “ Sex – for - Contract “ or “ Sex – for - Favor “ activities for bosses & management , Especially China women , Filipino women & etc. . . . ANOTHER MAIN REASON is that existing employees , Especially the foreigners & older staff that are less educated , & even top management are often jealous of highly educated Singaporean , Especially younger Singaporean , & scare of losing their jobs to them , AS WELL AS , bring about changes that can affect their “ Comfortable Life / Zone “ in work place. So the existing management & staff PURPOSELY ERECT " PROTECTIONISM " in work places to create very hostile environment to kick out Singaporean employees from jobs , just like the “ Bumiputera “ Policies in Malaysia. Hence , the VERY CRUEL FACT is that the more Singaporean are better Educated & Good , the more they are going to be sacked from their jobs , due to such hidden dark sides of such employers . . . These usually happen in Construction Industries, Heavy Engineering Industries & many other industries that are Labour Intensive & Highly Conservative , in which BOTH UNPROFESSIONALISM & UNETHICAL PRATICES HAVE BECOME A WAY OF LIFE in the CORPORATE / INDUSTRIAL CULTURES in such industries over many years. ] [ TYPICAL EXAMPLE : = The Strike by the China bus drivers in 2012. These China bus drivers do this due to their POOR LIVING CONDITIONS , besides their LOW SALARIES , are a GOOD EXAMPLE on Why Companies prefer to hire " Foreign Talents " over Singaporean BECAUSE " Foreign Talents " are Cheap & ALSO can be Abuse, Exploit & Eat alive Easily , AS WELL AS , don't threaten the interests & “ Comfortable Life / Zone “ of existing staff & management Now this recent Big Riot in Little India is ANOTHER TYPICAL EXAMPLE . . . ] Using OLD THIRD WORLD MANAGEMENT METHODS to RUN FIRST CLASS ECONOMY Definitely lead to Very Big Disasters & Destruction to our Society , our Job Security & Singapore Economy . DPM Teo had MENTION in Mass Media that Corruption has NOT BECOME A WAY of LIFE in Singapore , or have not become a kind of BAD SOCIAL CULTURES & EVIL SOCIAL VALUES in Singapore , after the Exposure of the Corruption Scandal of a senior CPIB officer. However, I am wondering why DPM Teo & Singapore Civil Service , which is BOTH the HIGHEST PAID & MOST EXPENSIVE CIVIL SERVICE in the World , have NOT CHECK on these type of BAD CORPORATE CULTURE & BAD CORPORATE VALUES have become a WAY of LIFE in Singapore Labour Market for so many years ? ? ? Any COMMENTS from you PEOPLE out there ? ? ?
