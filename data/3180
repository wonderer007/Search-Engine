A push for affordable housing in glitzy Dubai May 2, 2014Construction workers in Dubai. (Paul Keller/ flickr/ CC) Home to the world’s only 7-star hotel, Dubai is synonymous with luxurious living.  Now, some government officials want developers to offer more affordable housing alongside the upscale condos and villas, Sajila Saseendran  in the Khaleej Times.
Inexpensive housing is needed for migrants who fill low-wage construction and service jobs, as well as foreigners who take desk jobs but find housing costs steep. New
indicates that the city needs more than 260,000 affordable units between now and 2020, according to Construction Week.
“It is the mixed-use projects what we are lacking in,” Abdullah Raffia, head of the emirate’s Sustainability Committee, tells Saseendran. Instead, the emphasis is on high-end projects, says Raffia.
There could be a silver lining: Najib Mohammed Saleh, overseer of the city’s master urban plan, , says policies and guidelines for low-cost housing and community facilities will be addressed in the strategy's next phase.
