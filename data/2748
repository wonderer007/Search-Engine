About Our Client
Our Client is a developer and aggregator of mobile Value Added Services that make a difference. Unless our products provide a unique customer experience and an immediate impact on the operator’s bottom line, we don’t range them.
Our client is a leading independent distributor of Mobile Network Infrastructure solutions, which in turn is part of a group that is the largest provider of Logistics, Financial and Distribution services in Africa.
myADD
Our Client is in the process of developing a revolutionary Mobile Advertising platform, myADD, which serves Audio-ads to parties calling myADD subscribers: instead of a ringback tone, callers will be served advertisements from local and global brands.
The platform comes with sophisticated Bidding, Profiling and DTMF functionalities which optimize Ad prices. Generating revenues from calls instead of from the more commonly known OTT in-Screen/Web/App/Games Ads, myADD enables Mobile Operators to truly tap into Mobile Advertising revenues.
