Tecom Business Parks, a subsidiary of Tecom Investments, is expecting creation of nearly 11,000 new jobs being across its nine business parks this year.
“Last year was an exceptional year, we saw a 23 per cent increase in number of knowledge workers. Our expectation is very positive for 2014 and if we can achieve this number (23 per cent) that will be remarkable,” Malek Al Malek, Chief Executive Officer, Tecom Business Parks, told Emirates 24|7.
In 2013, Tecom Business Parks signed up 549 new businesses across its nine free zones, with the number of knowledge workers rising 23 per cent to reach 58,000, creating approximately 11,000 new jobs.
Dubai is going to create 277,000 new jobs in the run up to World Expo 2020.
Targeting 15% growth
Malek believes Tecom business parks will continue to grow by over 15 per cent this year.
“We have always witnessed more than 15 per cent business growth from our partners, but it varies from industry to other industries,” he said.
The number of ICT businesses grew by 181, the sciences’ cluster saw 57 new businesses, the education cluster added 67 companies while the media cluster saw 233 business partners.
Dubai Internet City also inaugurated In5, a start-up innovation centre providing mentorship, support and a dynamic and engaging working environment to entrepreneurs and small businesses.
In order to meet the growing demand, the Tecom Investments subsidiary is building four new commercial projects at the cost of Dh1 billion, which will add over one million square feet of space across it free zones.
Tecom Business Parks include Dubai Internet City and Dubai Outsource Zone, together forming an ICT Cluster; Dubai Media City, Dubai Studio City and the International Media Production Zone, make up the Media Cluster; Dubai Knowledge Village and Dubai International Academic City, creating an Education cluster; and DuBiotech and Enpark, forming the Sciences Cluster.
