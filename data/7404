Description
Always wanted to start your career at one of the best e-commerce companies in the world? Ever thought about moving to the one of the best expat countries in the world?
Welcome to Singapore!
Forget the image of Singapore as a dull, sterile Utopia – dive into this beautiful island country and you’ll discover a multicultural mix of Chinese, Malay, Indian and Western cultures, a rich social environment that’s anything but boring. The richness comes back in Singapore’s cuisine: mouthwatering Asian delights that are heavy on the flavor, but light on the wallet.
For your personal time, Singapore offers you Southeast Asia’s best shopping and innovative, stylish restaurants. Not so much into shopping and dining? Start a dynamic life with a wide range of outdoor activities: walking, cycling and water sports or check out the modern arts scene.
Time for a break? Check out the island sparkling reservoirs and flourishing forest where all you’ll hear are monkeys clattering through the boughs. Lion City will offer you paradise!
