Further information
Our global law firm clients directory rated Singapore corporate team has advised on some of the most high profile transactions in the region over many years, where it has acted for clients across a plethora of industry sectors not only in Singapore but across Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Korea, the Philippines, Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and the Indian subcontinent.
Due to a sustained increase in deal flow an opportunity has arisen for an English law qualified candidate with a minimum of 4 years PQE (UK equivalent) to join their high profile team. The successful applicant will be able to demonstrate excellent technical skills, leadership qualities and strong experience in complex M&A work while those that have gained exposure to working with local counsel on significant cross border deals would hold a distinct advantage.
