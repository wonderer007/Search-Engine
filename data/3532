The Gulf Recruitment Group
The Gulf Recruitment Group was designed to be a bit different.
This is a firm where some thought has gone into what our clients and candidates really want, and how best to deliver those services in the Gulf Region.
The result is a company that employs the best talent, embraces the best technology, enjoys old fashioned relationships and takes pride in delivering a truly refreshing customer experience.
We have the genuine ambition to be the most effective and respected firm in the Middle East, and to do so we haven't reinvented the wheel, we just improved it.
