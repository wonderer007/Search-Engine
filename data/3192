Carpool Arabia is the first carpooling solution dedicated to the Middle EastWhile commuting everyday from Dubai to Abu Dhabi, founder Benjamin made a simple observation: most of the cars on the road have single driver. It could take him up to 2 hours to reach the office because of the traffic congestion.By using Carpool Arabia, you not only save money but you also promote a more sustainable way of driving. Also, using Carpool Arabia saves natural resources and builds a stronger community by having co-workers help each other.
