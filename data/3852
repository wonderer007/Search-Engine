Hey,
Dubai recruitment agents sucks, job ads sucks. All these are BS. I was one of the early victims of the freaking global financial crisis. My employer in South Africa kicked me out after 15 years of service. Job sucks. I wanted to get an overseas job and Dubai was my first choice.
Man I can tell you there are many Dubai job vacancies on the internet than the world population. These guys sucks. I
applied to nearly 30 jobs in my field and none of them even sent me an email.
Thanks to the tips in your ebook I managed to get a good job in Dubai without going through all these shit job ads.
Many thanks to you guys,
