WAM Abu Dhabi, 30th April 2014 (WAM) -- Sheikh Hamdan bin Mubarak Al Nahyan, Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research, and Chancellor of UAE University, has called on the "International Labor Day", which is marked on Thursday (1/5/2014), all stakeholders to fulfill their roles concerning the strategic planning for the Emiratisation of the different sectors of the State.Sheikh Hamdan referred to the words of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE as saying: "work is the true criterion of citizenship, and it is proof of sincerity and loyalty, which distinguishes people. By strong willpower, high ability, and superior achievement, we all share the responsibility of building this country to support its sovereignty, protect its gains, and build its future." Sheikh Hamdan said that all ministries, federal institutions, local government, and the private sector in the State, along with civil society organizations and local and private higher education institutions, should take into consideration the developments and global studies conducted on the reality of employment in the countries of the world, especially those who are heading towards the green economy, which is not an option anymore, rather, it is a necessity to achieve the millennium goals of sustainable development, so that those authorities' long, medium, and short term plans should include the strategies and necessary tools to achieve this empowerment and transformation.He clarified that, based on the global model of economy and labor market, the usual work approach, and the green investment scenario concerning recruitment in general , are consistent with the predictions that there are no changes or overall gains in this field, with the possibility that the net direct employment will decrease in the short and medium terms, and the green investments will achieve gains in employment during (2030-2050), to catch up with the usual work approach and probably surpass it. The predictions of creating jobs as per the regions and countries vary due to the differences of effects that proved to be the catalyzer for jobs during the transformation into a green economy. On the other hand, he added, other jobs will be established or created during the transformation period, and the existing jobs will require investments in skills development and rehabilitation.He stressed on the growing role of educational institutions to prepare for all the required specialties, especially those developed, which are concerned with the infrastructure of green sustainable development, such as renewable energy, especially nuclear and solar, and sustainable construction sectors.He also valued the role of the Emirati media in this regard, especially the economic media concerned with providing a database, statistics, and information which deliver the concept of green economy to the Emirati community of all ages and educational and cultural levels, because the desired empowerment will not succeed without the integration of the various segments of society in this strategic decision, supported by the supreme leadership headed by the His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan", President of UAE, who took the lead and led the region in this field, and he is confident that the State and its people will have what it takes to achieve the dream and empowerment. The leadership also strives to attract and help the countries of the world to walk in the same direction, which was manifested in the "World Green Economy Summit 2014", held in "Dubai" in April (2014), which stressed that the UAE is one of the leading countries in the field of green economy, and a global center for the export and re-export of green products and technologies, while maintaining a sustainable environment that supports the economic growth in the long run. The summit also confirmed the pivotal role of the UAE in support of the global value chain of the sectors of technologies and green products, which is witnessing a tremendous growth, and their size is expected to reach (20) trillion Dollars by (2020), according the "International Energy Agency." In conclusion, the minister said that the entry of the State's economy into the category of "economies based on creativity and innovation" since (2006), which are the economies that can maintain higher levels of salaries, and the strategic planning to improve the quality of life and living standards, are the biggest proof of the labor market efficiency in the UAE, which was ranked seventh in the world in the report of the "World Economic Forum" for the year (2012-2013).WAM/tfaham
