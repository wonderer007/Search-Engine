Canada Jobs 2015 Although there is no fee for attending one of our four information conferences, professionals who register to attend and pass our application screening questions would get an invite. SkillsInternational career counselors will make it easy for you to move to Canada, get a high-paying job, and quickly establish yourself in the culture and economy.
Express Entry 2015 The Canadian Government believes it can and should compete actively to attract the best and brightest newcomers to resettle here. That’s why we are getting set to treat most immigration applications in a revolutionary new way. Having a job is the best path to economic integration. Express Entry will select immigrants based on the skills Canadian employers need and, in turn, should they pursue citizenship, they will be welcomed as equal members of the Canadian family.
