SINGAPORE — Invoking the spirit of the Pioneer Generation which overcame great odds and helped set the nation on the path of development, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s May Day speech today (April 30) called on workers and employers to do their part and help create a better Singapore for future generations.Though many of Singapore’s pioneers had come from other lands, Mr Lee in his message recalled how they came together to battle the Communists and worked with the Government to foster constructive labour-management relations. It was their efforts that built a competitive economy that meant better lives for all, he said.
Today, as Singapore builds on the efforts of the Pioneer Generation, it needs to remember that “developing better workers and creating better jobs is our collective responsibility,” said Mr Lee.“Each tripartite partner must do their part: Workers must make the effort to train and upgrade themselves. Employers must invest in workers, develop their skills, and make full use of their talents.“Only then will the Government’s programmes bear fruit. By working together, we strengthen our model of tripartism, and keep it our lasting competitive advantage,” he said.Mr Lee’s May Day message in full:“Singapore is undergoing a major transition. Our economy is upgrading qualitatively, and expanding less quickly than before. Last year we did well: Growth was 4.1%, and wages and household incomes rose broadly. This year we expect to grow 2-4%, which is typical of a maturing economy.We are strengthening our social safety nets to give Singaporeans more peace of mind. MediShield Life and the expanded Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) will help Singaporeans meet their medical needs. Permanent GST Vouchers will offset daily expenses. Larger education and pre-school subsidies will benefit all families, especially the lower-income. The Pioneer Generation Package will honour and help the seniors who started us on this nation-building journey.
