I am here on a contract but want to consider a permanent job since I am liking it here so much.
Where is the best place to look for a job over here?

Glad that you're enjoying your stay here! There are a lot of job posting sites, but people mostly frequent Dubizzle or Gulf Talent. Also try LinkedIn, as some of the talent recruiters post vacancies there. What field are you interested in? And what are your qualifications?

you have the advantage of being here.
you have the advantage of being here, and being in work.
Use the contacts you have at work, in your industry to actively seek work at similar companies / competitors, etc.
that's a better option than trawling the websites, in my opinion.
how long have you got left in your current position?
make a plan, and get on it!

I personally wouldn't use Dubizzle as a job search portal.
LinkedIn
Total Jobs
Monster Gulf
Gulf Talent
Reed
hays
matchworkers
jca-associates
millerhay
etc etc
likes this.

Put it this way I know of companies that advertise heavily on Dubizzle advertising jobs/property/cars etc just to harvest data then sell that on to IFA's so that's why I don't use or recommend it as it's a waste of time IMO.
