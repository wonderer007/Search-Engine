More employees likely to quit jobs in finance sector
Six in 10 employees expected to change jobs this year
By Cleofe Maceda, Senior Reporter
Published: 18:48 April 30, 2014
The financial services industry in the region is likely to see more people quitting their jobs this year over unfulfilled bonus expectations.
According to the latest eFinancialCareers survey, nearly six in 10 (58 per cent) of finance professionals in the region intend to change jobs in 2014. “This would suggest that reality versus expectation were not in line,” said James Randall of eFinancialCareers Gulf.
“The level of employees looking for a new job is also worrying. If employers can’t meet their employee’s bonus expectations, they will need to find new ways to strengthen the loyalty of their talent,” said James Bennett, global managing director of eFinancialCareers.
With regards to base salary, 52 per cent of the finance professionals in the region reported getting an increase.
Outside the Middle East, a smaller proportion of finance professionals were dismayed by their bonus payouts. In Singapore, 42 per cent said their bonuses were beneath expectations, compared to 41 per cent in the UK, 38 per cent in the US and 33 per cent in Hong Kong.
