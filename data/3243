Important
Teachanywhere's mission is to match teachers with jobs and schools with teachers but unfortunately we cannot help everyone.
Our clients are overseas primary (elementary) and secondary (high school) international schools and organisations that have
very specific requirements with which we must comply.
Please only apply to this job if you meet the following two requirements:
1. You are completely fluent in English and have teaching experience and/or teacher training from one of the countries from which we recruit:
Australia
Canada
Ireland
New Zealand
South Africa
United Kingdom
United States
If you meet the criteria above we can consider you legally able to work for the purposes of this job application.
AND
2. You meet our teacher training requirements, which are:
You are a certified/qualified teacher with teacher training and qualifications that enable you to teach in state schools in
one of the countries listed above. Normally you will have teacher training such as a bachelor's of education, higher diploma in education,
qualified teacher status or full state teacher certification
If you do not meet these criteria it is very unlikely we can help you as we do not normally recruit untrained teachers,
or work with candidates from other regions of the world. If there is some doubt, rather than registering here we ask that you send your CV
to teacher@teachanywhere.com and we will respond if we have a matching vacancy.
