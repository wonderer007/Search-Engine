The UAE travel and tourism sector is expected to create 245,000 jobs
directly by 2023, registering an annual growth rate of 4.1 per cent,
according to the latest research analysis released by Dubai Chamber of
Commerce and Industry, according to Emirates 24/7.The analysis
also found that capital investment in the sector is expected to rise
annually by an average of 4.5 per cent, to reach Dh143.4 billion in 2023.
This would increase travel and tourism’s share of the UAE’s total private
investments to about 23.2 per cent, up from 22.8 per cent in 2013.The
UAE is ranked the 28th among 139 countries and 1st in the Middle East in
the World Economic Forum’s "Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Report 2013".
Dubai plays a lead role, holding a 66 per cent share of the UAE’s tourism
economy, with Abu Dhabi having 16 per cent, and Sharjah 10 per cent.
