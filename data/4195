Connecting Minds, Creating the Future
For our bid to host the 2020 World Expo in Dubai, the UAE has selected the theme âConnecting Minds, Creating the Futureâ.
A World Expo in Dubai in 2020 would be the first to be held in the MENASA (Middle East, North Africa and South Asia) region. As the global community faces ever more complex, and increasingly interconnected challenges, the links between people, societies and ideas have never been more important. Dubai Expo 2020 will be a platform for connectivity to help pioneer new partnerships for growth and sustainability for the future
