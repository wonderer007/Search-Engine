Description
Founded in 1919, Halliburton is one of the world’s largest providers of products and services to the energy industry. With more than 75,000 employees, representing 140 nationalities in approximately 80 countries, the company serves the upstream oil and gas industry throughout the lifecycle of the reservoir – from locating hydrocarbons and managing geological data, to drilling and formation evaluation, well construction and completion, and optimizing production through the life of the field.
Our Business
Halliburton comprises 13 product service lines (PSLs). The PSLs operate in two divisions: Drilling and Evaluation, and Completion and Production. Our Consulting and Project Management PSL works across both divisions and is the spearhead of our integrated-services strategy. Its financial results are included in the Drilling and Evaluation Division. PSLs are primarily responsible and accountable for strategy, technology development, process development, people development and capital allocation.
A Global Transition
To strengthen our presence in the Eastern Hemisphere, Halliburton established a second headquarters in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The oil and gas business is moving its focus from the increasingly difficult reserves of the Western Hemisphere to the bounty of the Eastern Hemisphere. As the customers Halliburton serves make this shift, Halliburton is expanding eastward to provide new manufacturing capacity, move closer to key markets, and help reduce the costs of moving materials, products, tools and people.
